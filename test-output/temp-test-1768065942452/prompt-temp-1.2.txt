SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:
You are an expert character artist creating stylized avatar illustrations for children's books.
You are given a reference avatar for FACIAL IDENTITY ONLY.
Your task is to TRANSFORM the avatar into: pixar style wearing a completely different costume.
- Preserves the EXACT facial identity from the reference avatar
- IGNORES the reference clothing completely - apply the new costume instead
- IGNORES the reference body shape - generate a new body fitting the costume
- Creates all 4 grid quadrants with the SAME costume

USER PROMPT:
TASK: Create a 2x2 Character Concept Design Sheet / Orthographic Views. Use a GRID IMAGE with 4 views of the EXACT individual from the reference avatar.

STYLE (apply to entire image):
3D render, Pixar animation style, natural proportions, highly detailed textures, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, smooth shading

SUBJECT & COSTUME (PRIORITY) - medieval peasant:
A medieval peasant outfit: rough brown linen tunic with rope belt, simple cream-colored undershirt with loose sleeves, brown wool pants, and worn leather boots. No hat or head covering.
CRITICAL: Change clothing COMPLETELY from reference. The character is wearing a historical/themed costume.
This is a COMPLETE outfit change from neck to toe. Include: shirt/top, pants/skirt/dress, footwear, and any accessories.
The costume should look authentic and age-appropriate for a children's book illustration.

REFERENCE IMAGE PROVIDED:
- Standard avatar reference for FACIAL IDENTITY ONLY
- Ignore reference clothing
- Ignore reference body shape

REFERENCE INTEGRITY:
- FACE: 100% identical to reference avatar. Preserve exact age, ethnicity, eye color, and facial features.
- Direct replication, not averaged - same face shape, features, expression style
- The person must be clearly recognizable as the same individual
- If the subject is a child, they MUST remain a child with child-like proportions and features. Do not mature the face.
- If the subject has specific facial markers (moles, scars, eye shape), these MUST be retained with 100% accuracy.
- BODY: Ignore reference outfit. Generate new body fitting the costume.
- Use age-appropriate head-to-body ratio (Reference: Infant=4, Child=6, Teen=7, Adult=8)
- HAIR: Keep natural hair color and style from reference. NO HATS, HELMETS, CROWNS, OR HEAD COVERINGS of any kind.
- FACE MUST BE FULLY VISIBLE: NO face masks, ninja masks, superhero masks, bandanas, veils, or anything covering/obstructing the face. The face must remain 100% visible for character recognition.
- NO "BEAUTIFICATION". Do not apply "Standard Fashion Model" features. The face must be a literal duplicate of the reference.
