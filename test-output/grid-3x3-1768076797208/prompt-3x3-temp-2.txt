Create a 3x4 character sheet (3 rows, 4 columns = 12 portrait images) in pixar animation style.

IMPORTANT: Generate 12 CLOSE RELATIVES of the person in the reference photo.
They should look VERY SIMILAR (like siblings or cousins) but NOT 100% IDENTICAL.

Each portrait should have SLIGHT DIFFERENCES in:
- Face shape (rounder, longer, wider)
- Eye spacing and size
- Nose shape and size
- Chin and jaw shape
- Cheekbone prominence

ALL 12 portraits must:
- Be face/shoulder close-ups facing forward
- Show the SAME costume: A dashing pirate captain outfit: long navy blue coat with gold trim and brass buttons, white ruffled shirt underneath, brown leather belt with gold buckle, black boots. No hat - hair flowing freely.
- Have HAPPY expression with LIPS CLOSED (gentle smile)
- Be clearly recognizable as related to the reference person
- Be in pixar style: 3D render, Pixar animation style, natural proportions, highly detailed textures, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, smooth shading

Background: Light grey studio in each cell.
Make each face DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT but clearly from the same family.
