Create a 3x4 character sheet (3 rows, 4 columns = 12 images) in pixar animation style.

Show the SAME young person from the reference in 12 views, ALL wearing: A dashing pirate captain outfit: long navy blue coat with gold trim and brass buttons, white ruffled shirt underneath, brown leather belt with gold buckle, black boots. No hat - hair flowing freely.

GRID LAYOUT (3 rows x 4 columns):
Row 1: 4 face close-ups, ALL facing STRAIGHT forward at camera
Row 2: 4 face close-ups, ALL facing SLIGHTLY RIGHT (3/4 profile)
Row 3: 2 full body facing straight | 2 full body facing right

EXPRESSION: ALL 12 images show HAPPY expression with LIPS CLOSED (gentle smile, no teeth)

IMPORTANT - FACE VARIATIONS:
- Keep the SAME face identity but add SLIGHT STRUCTURAL variations
- Vary: face width, eye spacing, nose size, chin shape slightly
- This helps find which variation best matches the reference
- All variations should still be recognizable as the same person

Style: 3D render, Pixar animation style, natural proportions, highly detailed textures, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, smooth shading
Background: Light grey studio in each cell
Same costume in ALL 12 images.
