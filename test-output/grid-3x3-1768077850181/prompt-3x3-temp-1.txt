Create a 2x2 character sheet (2 rows, 2 columns = 4 images) in pixar animation style.

GRID LAYOUT:

TOP ROW - FACE ONLY (EXTREME CLOSE-UP):
- TOP-LEFT: ONLY THE FACE. Crop at hairline, chin, and ears. NOTHING BELOW THE CHIN. No neck. No shoulders. No clothing. Just forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin. Looking STRAIGHT at camera.
- TOP-RIGHT: ONLY THE FACE. Same extreme crop. Head turned 30 degrees TO THE RIGHT (we see more of the left cheek). FACE FILLS THE ENTIRE FRAME.

BOTTOM ROW - FULL BODY WITH COSTUME:
- BOTTOM-LEFT: Full body front view wearing: A dashing pirate captain outfit: long navy blue coat with gold trim and brass buttons, white ruffled shirt underneath, brown leather belt with gold buckle, black boots. No hat - hair flowing freely.
- BOTTOM-RIGHT: Full body side view (facing right) wearing the same costume.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL 4 images show the EXACT SAME PERSON from the reference
- TOP ROW: FACE ONLY. Imagine a passport photo cropped even tighter. ZERO clothing visible. ZERO shoulders. ZERO neck. The frame edge cuts at the chin.
- BOTTOM ROW: Full body showing the complete costume from head to toe
- Expression: Happy, gentle smile, lips closed
- Style: 3D render, Pixar animation style, natural proportions, highly detailed textures, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, smooth shading
- Background: Light grey studio in all 4 cells

TOP = identity reference (face only), BOTTOM = costume showcase (full body).
