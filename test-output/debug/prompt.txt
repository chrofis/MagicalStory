TASK: Create a 2x2 Character Concept Design Sheet / Orthographic Views. Use a GRID IMAGE with 4 views of the EXACT individual from the reference photos.

OUTPUT STYLE: PHOTOREALISTIC - This must look like a professional fashion photograph, NOT a cartoon, NOT animated, NOT Pixar style.

GRID LAYOUT (with clear black dividing lines between quadrants):
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│  TOP LEFT       │  TOP RIGHT      │
│  Face - Front   │  Face - 3/4     │
│  (looking at    │  Profile (75°   │
│   camera)       │   looking RIGHT)│
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│  BOTTOM LEFT    │  BOTTOM RIGHT   │
│  Full Body      │  Full Body      │
│  Front View     │  Profile View   │
│  (facing camera)│  (facing RIGHT) │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘

CRITICAL GRID REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean 2x2 collage layout with a thin neutral divider.
- Both profile views (top right and bottom right) the face looks towards the RIGHT
- Each quadrant has solid light grey (off-white) studio background
- All 4 quadrants show the SAME outfit. If the outfit has pattern/ logos the must be identical in size, color, and placement in all four views.

VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Face: 100% identical to reference photo. Direct replication, not averaged.
- Expression: Natural, friendly SMILE. The person should look happy and approachable.
- Body: Generate age-appropriate body proportions based on the apparent age visible in the reference photo.
- Setting: Pure clean white background (#FFFFFF) in each quadrant.
- Lighting: Natural, even, studio-style diffused light.
- Top quadrants: Head and shoulders, face clearly visible
- Bottom quadrants: Full body, head to toe. Shoes visible.

BODY TRANSFORMATION (CRITICAL):
- Generate the person with an ATHLETIC, FIT body type by default
- Do NOT preserve overweight or heavy body proportions from the reference photo
- Keep the EXACT same face and identity, but transform the body to be slim and athletic
- For children: fit and healthy, age-appropriate athletic proportions

IDENTITY PERSISTENCE:
- Hair and face must be fully visible. Avoid hats and hoods.
- Biometric precision: The face must not be averaged or replaced.
- Focus: Ultra-sharp focus on facial features.
- Enforce an age-accurate head-to-body ratio to ensure skeletal proportions match the facial age (Reference: Infant=4, Child=6, Teen=7, Adult=8)

WARDROBE DETAILS:
- Style Transfer Rule: Copy the EXACT pattern AND colors from the input image. Just change from short to long sleeves / legs, etc.
- If parts of the clothing are not visible in the input picture use plain/solid neutral colors (black, navy, khaki, gray, brown) to create them. Added / invented parts of the clothing MUST be DIFFERENT from input image. NEVER apply the shirt's pattern or bright colors to the pants.
- NO LAYERED CLOTHING: Generate single-layer outfits only. Coats, hoodies, and jackets must be CLOSED/ZIPPED - no visible garments underneath. One top garment only.
- Outfit: Long-sleeved dress, T-shirt, or cozy sweater with the SAME pattern AND colors as the input image clothing. Jeans or leggings. Casual shoes.

Output Quality: 4k, Photorealistic.
