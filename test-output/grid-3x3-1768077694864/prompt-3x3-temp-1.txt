Create a 2x2 character sheet (2 rows, 2 columns = 4 images) in pixar animation style.

GRID LAYOUT:

TOP ROW - FACE ONLY (EXTREME CLOSE-UP):
- TOP-LEFT: ONLY THE FACE. Crop at hairline, chin, and ears. NOTHING BELOW THE CHIN. No neck. No shoulders. No clothing. No hair below ears. Just forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin. Front view.
- TOP-RIGHT: ONLY THE FACE. Same extreme crop. 3/4 angle. FACE FILLS THE ENTIRE FRAME.

BOTTOM ROW - FULL BODY WITH COSTUME:
- BOTTOM-LEFT: Full body front view wearing: A dashing pirate captain outfit: long navy blue coat with gold trim and brass buttons, white ruffled shirt underneath, brown leather belt with gold buckle, black boots. No hat - hair flowing freely.
- BOTTOM-RIGHT: Full body side view (facing right) wearing the same costume.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL 4 images show the EXACT SAME PERSON from the reference
- TOP ROW: FACE ONLY. Imagine a passport photo cropped even tighter. ZERO clothing visible. ZERO shoulders. ZERO neck. The frame edge cuts at the chin.
- BOTTOM ROW: Full body showing the complete costume from head to toe
- Expression: Happy, gentle smile, lips closed
- Style: 3D render, Pixar animation style, natural proportions, highly detailed textures, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, smooth shading
- Background: Light grey studio in all 4 cells

TOP = identity reference (face only), BOTTOM = costume showcase (full body).
