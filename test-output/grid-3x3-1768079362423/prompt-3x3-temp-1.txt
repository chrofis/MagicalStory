Create a 2x2 character sheet (2 rows, 2 columns = 4 images) in pixar animation style.

GRID LAYOUT:

TOP ROW - FACE ONLY (no clothing visible):
- TOP-LEFT: EXACT copy of the reference face, zoomed in to show ONLY the face. Front view, looking at camera. No shoulders, no neck, no clothing. Forehead to chin only.
- TOP-RIGHT: SAME face, but HEAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT. Nose pointing toward right edge of image. We see more of left cheek, less of right cheek. Same zoom level - face only, no shoulders.

BOTTOM ROW - FULL BODY WITH COSTUME:
- BOTTOM-LEFT: Full body front view wearing: A dashing pirate captain outfit: long navy blue coat with gold trim and brass buttons, white ruffled shirt underneath, brown leather belt with gold buckle, black boots. No hat - hair flowing freely.
- BOTTOM-RIGHT: Full body side view (facing right) wearing the same costume.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL 4 images show the EXACT SAME PERSON
- TOP-LEFT: Face only, front view, identical to reference
- TOP-RIGHT: Face only, turned right (nose toward right edge)
- BOTTOM: Full body with costume
- Style: 3D render, Pixar animation style, natural proportions, highly detailed textures, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, smooth shading
