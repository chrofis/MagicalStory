Create a 2x2 character sheet (2 rows, 2 columns = 4 images) in watercolor animation style.

GRID LAYOUT:

TOP ROW - FACE ONLY (no clothing visible):
- TOP-LEFT: EXACT copy of the reference face, zoomed in to show ONLY the face. Front view, looking at camera. No shoulders, no neck, no clothing. Forehead to chin only.
- TOP-RIGHT: SAME face, but HEAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT. Nose pointing toward right edge of image. We see more of left cheek, less of right cheek. Same zoom level - face only, no shoulders.

BOTTOM ROW - FULL BODY WITH COSTUME:
- BOTTOM-LEFT: Full body front view wearing: A magical fairy princess outfit: flowing lavender dress with sparkly tulle skirt, delicate butterfly wings on back, silver tiara with tiny gems, barefoot with flower anklets, small wand with star tip.
- BOTTOM-RIGHT: Full body side view (facing right) wearing the same costume.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL 4 images show the EXACT SAME PERSON
- TOP-LEFT: Face only, front view, identical to reference
- TOP-RIGHT: Face only, turned right (nose toward right edge)
- BOTTOM: Full body with costume
- Style: Traditional watercolor painting style, soft color washes, gentle edges, artistic brushwork, textured paper appearance, delicate and dreamy aesthetic
