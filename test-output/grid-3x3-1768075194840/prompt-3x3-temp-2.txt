⚠️ MANDATORY OUTPUT STYLE: 3D render, Pixar animation style, natural proportions, highly detailed textures, soft studio lighting, vibrant colors, smooth shading
DO NOT CREATE PHOTO-REALISTIC OUTPUT. CREATE AN ILLUSTRATION.

TASK: Create a 3x3 grid (9 images) of the SAME character. 8 images show the NEW COSTUME, 1 image (middle-center) shows the ORIGINAL clothing styled.

NEW COSTUME - pirate captain:
A dashing pirate captain outfit: long navy blue coat with gold trim and brass buttons, white ruffled shirt underneath, brown leather belt with gold buckle, black boots. No hat - hair flowing freely.

GRID LAYOUT (3 rows x 3 columns):

TOP ROW - All 3 faces looking FORWARD at camera, wearing NEW COSTUME:
| Top-Left: Face front, costumed | Top-Center: Face front, costumed | Top-Right: Face front, costumed |

MIDDLE ROW - Faces looking RIGHT, except middle-center ANCHOR looks FORWARD:
| Middle-Left: Face right, costumed | Middle-Center: ANCHOR - Face FRONT, Original clothes, styled (NO costume) | Middle-Right: Face right, costumed |

BOTTOM ROW - Full body views, wearing NEW COSTUME:
| Bottom-Left: Full body front | Bottom-Center: Full body front | Bottom-Right: Full body facing right |

IMPORTANT - SLIGHT FACE VARIATIONS:
- Add SLIGHT natural variations between faces (subtle expression changes, minor angle shifts)
- This helps test which variation best preserves identity
- Variations should be subtle - still clearly the same person
- The ANCHOR (middle-center) should match reference most closely

CRITICAL:
- ALL 9 images show the SAME PERSON (same identity from reference)
- 8 images wear the NEW COSTUME
- 1 image (middle-center) wears ORIGINAL CLOTHES from reference - this is the styled ANCHOR
- pixar illustrated style throughout (NOT photo-realistic)
- Light grey studio background in each cell

REFERENCE IMAGE: Extract facial identity. Middle-center copies the pose/clothes but in illustration style.
