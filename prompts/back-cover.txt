Create a back cover illustration for a children's book.

{BACK_COVER_SCENE}

Style: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}.

{CHARACTER_INFO}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE but in the artistic style
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

**CHARACTER COMPOSITION - CRITICAL:**
- Include ALL characters from the story in this image
- Give EQUAL visual prominence to ALL characters - no one should dominate
- Do NOT focus on or emphasize the main character - everyone is equally important here
- Arrange characters as a balanced GROUP where each person has similar size and visibility
- This is a celebratory group scene - like a family/group photo where everyone matters equally

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact text: "magicalstory.ch"
- Position it in the bottom left corner
- Use elegant, readable letters
- Do NOT add any other text - ONLY "magicalstory.ch"
