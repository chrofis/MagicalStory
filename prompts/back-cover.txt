Create a back cover illustration for a children's book.

**SCENE:**
{BACK_COVER_SCENE}

**ART STYLE:** {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE but styled artistically
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

**COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:**
- This is a GROUP scene - include all characters together
- Give EQUAL visual prominence to all characters - like a family/group photo
- Arrange characters as a balanced group where each person is clearly visible
- This should feel like a satisfying, warm conclusion to the story

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact text: "magicalstory.ch"
- Position it in the bottom left corner
- Use elegant, readable letters
- Do NOT add any other text - ONLY "magicalstory.ch"
