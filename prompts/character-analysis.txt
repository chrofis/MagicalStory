}

IMPORTANT:
- Be extremely specific about colors (not "blue" but "light sky blue")
- Be exact about hair details (color, length, style, texture)
- Note distinctive features that make this person recognizable
- The styleDNA.signatureColors should reflect colors that suit this person (from hair, eyes, skin tone)
- Do NOT describe clothing - clothing will be determined by the scene context
- If something is not visible, use "not visible"

Respond with ONLY valid JSON, no additional text.
