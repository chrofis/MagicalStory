Analyze this image of a person for a children's book illustration system.
Extract visual attributes that will maintain consistency across different scenes.

Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure:

{
  "traits": {
    "age": "<estimated age as a number, e.g. 8, 25, 45>",
    "gender": "<male, female, or other>",
    "height": "<tall, average, short>",
    "build": "<slim, average, athletic, stocky>"
  },
  "styleAnalysis": {
    "physical": {
      "face": "<detailed: face shape, eye color, skin tone, distinctive features like freckles, dimples, birthmarks, glasses>",
      "hair": "<exact: specific color like 'honey blonde', length, style, texture, any accessories like ribbons/clips>",
      "build": "<body type and apparent age, e.g. 'Slim build, appears to be around 9 years old'>"
    }
  }
}

IMPORTANT:
- Be extremely specific about colors (not "blue" but "light sky blue")
- Be exact about hair details (color, length, style, texture)
- Note distinctive features that make this person recognizable
- Do NOT describe clothing - clothing will be determined by the scene context
- If something is not visible, use "not visible"

Respond with ONLY valid JSON, no additional text.
