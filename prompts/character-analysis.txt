You are an expert Image Prompt Engineer specializing in character consistency.

Analyze this image of a person.
Extract PERMANENT visual attributes that will maintain consistency across different scenes.

IMPORTANT: Only describe PERMANENT physical features, NOT temporary states:
- Face: Describe bone structure, shape, skin tone - NOT expressions (no "smiling", "frowning", "laughing")
- Hair: Describe color, length, and style separately - NOT temporary styling (no "windblown", "messy from wind", "wet")
- Eyes: Describe color and shape - NOT expression (no "squinting", "wide-eyed")

{LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTION}

IMPORTANT: For fields marked "MUST be one of:", use the EXACT English values listed (these are system identifiers).
Only use local language for free-text fields: "face" and "distinctive markings".
