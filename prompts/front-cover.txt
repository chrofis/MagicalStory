Create a front cover illustration for a children's book.

**SCENE:**
{TITLE_PAGE_SCENE}

**ART STYLE:** {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE but styled artistically
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

**COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:**
- The MAIN CHARACTER should be the focal point - prominent, centered, and clearly the star
- Supporting characters (if present in scene) should be smaller or positioned to the sides/background
- Keep the composition simple and uncluttered
- Leave clear space at the TOP for the title text

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact title text: "{STORY_TITLE}"
- Make the title PROMINENT and highly visible at the top
- Use an attractive, readable font style that fits the art style
- The title is the ONLY text that should appear in the image
