Create a front cover illustration for a children's book.

{TITLE_PAGE_SCENE}

Style: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}.

{CHARACTER_INFO}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE but in the artistic style
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

IMPORTANT:
- The MAIN CHARACTER(S) must be the LARGEST figures in the image, positioned CENTRALLY and prominently featured.
- Supporting characters may appear smaller, in the background, or at the sides.

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact title text: "{STORY_TITLE}"
- Make the title PROMINENT and highly visible
- Integrate the title beautifully into the illustration
- Use an attractive, readable font style that fits the art style
- Position the title where it is clearly legible (typically top or center)
- The title is the ONLY text that should appear in the image
