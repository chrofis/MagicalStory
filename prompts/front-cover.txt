CHILDREN'S BOOK ILLUSTRATION - Safe, family-friendly content.
Create a front cover illustration for a children's book.

**SCENE:**
{TITLE_PAGE_SCENE}

**ART STYLE:** {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS - transform into the art style
- Characters must remain RECOGNIZABLE (hair color, face shape, age, gender)
- Render in artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters in the SAME consistent style
- Character CLOTHING: Use EXACTLY what is shown in the reference images (the correct outfit has been pre-selected)

{CHARACTER_REFERENCE_LIST}

**REFERENCE IMAGE USAGE (CRITICAL):**
- Reference photos are PROVIDED FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING ONLY
- DO NOT include reference photos, thumbnails, or numbered image grids in the generated image
- The output must be a SINGLE illustration showing ONLY the described scene
- Reference photos show what characters LOOK LIKE - use them to draw the characters accurately, but NEVER show the photos themselves

**COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:**
- ALL MAIN CHARACTERS should be prominently featured and clearly recognizable
- Characters should be arranged in a balanced composition (side by side, or grouped naturally)
- Keep the composition simple and uncluttered
- Leave clear space at the TOP for the title text

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact title text: "{STORY_TITLE}"
- Make the title PROMINENT and highly visible at the top
- Use an attractive, readable font style that fits the art style
- The title is the ONLY text that should appear in the image
