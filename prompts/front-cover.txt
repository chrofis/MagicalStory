Create a front cover illustration for a children's book.

{TITLE_PAGE_SCENE}

Style: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}.

{CHARACTER_INFO}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE but in the artistic style
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

**CHARACTER COMPOSITION - CRITICAL:**
- The MAIN CHARACTER must be the STAR of this image - LARGE, CENTRAL, and prominently featured
- Include MINIMAL other characters (ideally 0-2 supporting characters only)
- If supporting characters appear, they should be SMALLER, in the background, or partially visible
- This is the MAIN CHARACTER'S spotlight moment - they should dominate the image
- The main character should take up at least 40-50% of the image area

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact title text: "{STORY_TITLE}"
- Make the title PROMINENT and highly visible
- Integrate the title beautifully into the illustration
- Use an attractive, readable font style that fits the art style
- Position the title where it is clearly legible (typically top or center)
- The title is the ONLY text that should appear in the image
