}

IMPORTANT:
- Be extremely specific about colors (not "blue" but "light sky blue with slight grey undertone")
- Be exact about patterns (not "floral" but "small scattered roses in coral pink and cream white, approximately 1cm diameter")
- Note construction details that define the style (seam colors, trim types, collar styles)
- The styleDNA will be used to generate NEW outfits in different settings that still look like "this character's style"
- If something is not visible or not applicable, use "not visible" or "none"

Respond with ONLY the JSON, no additional text.
