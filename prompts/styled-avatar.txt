TASK: Create a 2x2 Character Concept Design Sheet / Orthographic Views. Use a GRID IMAGE with 4 views of the EXACT individual from the reference images, converted to the target art style.

REFERENCE IMAGES PROVIDED:
- Image 1: High-resolution face photo - use for EXACT facial identity (face shape, features, skin tone, eye color, hair)
- Image 2: Standard avatar showing current clothing and body proportions - preserve this outfit and build

ART STYLE (CRITICAL - apply to entire image):
{ART_STYLE_PROMPT}

GRID LAYOUT (with clear black dividing lines between quadrants):
+-------------------+-------------------+
|  TOP LEFT         |  TOP RIGHT        |
|  Face - Front     |  Face - 3/4       |
|  (looking at      |  Profile (75deg   |
|   camera)         |   looking RIGHT)  |
+-------------------+-------------------+
|  BOTTOM LEFT      |  BOTTOM RIGHT     |
|  Full Body        |  Full Body        |
|  Front View       |  Profile View     |
|  (facing camera)  |  (facing RIGHT)   |
+-------------------+-------------------+

GRID REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean 2x2 collage layout with a thin neutral divider
- Both profile views (top right and bottom right) MUST face the SAME direction (RIGHT)
- Each quadrant has solid light grey (off-white) studio background
- All 4 quadrants show the SAME outfit from Image 2. If the outfit has pattern/logos they must be identical in size, color, and placement in all four views.
- TOP QUADRANTS: Head and shoulders, face clearly visible
- BOTTOM QUADRANTS: Full body from head to toe, shoes visible

IDENTITY PERSISTENCE (CRITICAL):
- Face: 100% identical to Image 1 (face photo) - Direct replication, not averaged - same face shape, features, expression style
- Hair color, eye color, skin tone must match exactly from Image 1
- The output MUST preserve the exact age, ethnicity, facial geometry, and unique micro-markers of the person in Image 1
- If the subject is a child, they MUST remain a child with child-like proportions and features. Do not mature the face.
- If the subject has specific facial markers (moles, scars, eye shape), these MUST be retained with 100% accuracy.
- Body: Use the body proportions from Image 2 (standard avatar)
- Enforce an age-accurate head-to-body ratio to ensure skeletal proportions match the facial age (Reference: Infant=4, Child=6, Teen=7, Adult=8)
- Lighting: Natural, even, studio-style diffused light.
- NO "BEAUTIFICATION". Do not apply "Standard Fashion Model" features. The face must be a literal duplicate of Image 1.
- The goal is a photographic "Documentary" level of facial realism, rendered in the target art style.

CLOTHING (preserve from Image 2):
- Keep the EXACT same clothing visible in Image 2 (the standard avatar)
- Preserve all clothing colors, patterns, and accessories
- Do NOT change or modify the outfit in any way

Output: High quality 2x2 grid image in the specified art style.
