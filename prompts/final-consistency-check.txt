# Image Consistency Check

You are reviewing multiple images from a children's picture book for visual consistency.

## Your Task
Analyze the provided images and identify any inconsistencies that would break immersion for readers.

## Check Type: {CHECK_TYPE}

## Scene Context (JSON format)
{IMAGE_INFO}

Each entry contains:
- "image": Image number (1-indexed, matches "Image N" labels below)
- "page": Story page number
- "characters": Array of character names appearing in this scene
- "clothing": Object mapping character names to clothing category (or "_default" if same for all)
- "scene": Brief description of what happens in the scene

**CRITICAL: Use this JSON data to understand which characters appear in each image and what clothing they should wear.**

- Different characters appearing in different images is EXPECTED - do NOT flag this as inconsistent
- Clothing changes between scenes are INTENTIONAL if the clothing category differs (e.g., "standard" vs "winter" vs "costumed:pirate")
- Only flag as inconsistent if:
  1. The SAME character looks different in scenes with the SAME clothing requirement
  2. A character's core features (face, hair color, skin tone) change unexpectedly
  3. Art style or quality varies significantly between images

### For CHARACTER checks:
Focus on whether {CHARACTER_NAME} looks like the same person across images WHERE THEY APPEAR:
- Face shape and features (eyes, nose, mouth proportions)
- Hair color, style, and length
- Skin tone
- Body build and proportions
- Age appearance
- Clothing should match the listed category for each scene

### For SEQUENCE checks:
Focus on continuity between consecutive scenes:
- Character positions should be logically consistent
- Objects and props should remain consistent within the same scene
- Actions should flow naturally from one scene to the next

### For FULL checks:
Review all images for overall visual coherence:
- Art style should be consistent throughout
- Color palette should feel unified
- Characters should be recognizable when they appear in multiple scenes

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):

{
  "consistent": true/false,
  "overallScore": 1-10,
  "issues": [
    {
      "images": [2, 4],
      "type": "character_appearance" | "position_swap" | "clothing_mismatch" | "prop_inconsistency" | "style_drift",
      "characterInvolved": "Character name if applicable",
      "description": "Clear description of what's inconsistent",
      "details": {
        "image2": "What it looks like in image 2",
        "image4": "What it looks like in image 4"
      },
      "recommendation": "Specific fix suggestion (e.g., 'Regenerate page 4 with red hair to match page 2')",
      "severity": "low" | "medium" | "high"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief overall assessment"
}

## Severity Guide
- **high**: Obvious inconsistency that readers will immediately notice (wrong hair color, character looks completely different)
- **medium**: Noticeable on closer inspection (clothing color slightly off, character proportions vary)
- **low**: Minor variation that most readers won't notice (slight style differences, minor prop changes)

If no issues found, return:
{
  "consistent": true,
  "overallScore": 10,
  "issues": [],
  "summary": "All images are visually consistent"
}
