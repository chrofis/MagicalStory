Edit this children's storybook cover image to fix the text.

CURRENT TEXT IN IMAGE: "{ACTUAL_TEXT}"
CORRECT TEXT SHOULD BE: "{EXPECTED_TEXT}"

Instructions:
1. Find and replace the incorrect text "{ACTUAL_TEXT}" with the correct text "{EXPECTED_TEXT}"
2. Keep the EXACT same artistic style, colors, and font style as the original
3. Maintain the same text position and size
4. Do NOT change anything else in the image - only fix the text
5. The text should be clearly legible and properly spelled
6. Preserve all character appearances, backgrounds, and decorative elements

IMPORTANT: Only change the text, nothing else. The result should look like the original image but with the correct spelling.
