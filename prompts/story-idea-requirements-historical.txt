--- STORY REQUIREMENTS FOR HISTORICAL STORIES ---

STORY 1 REQUIREMENTS (PARTICIPANT - characters ARE the achievers):
The main characters ARE the historical achievers - they perform the famous deeds themselves.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - MUST START WITH ROLE ASSIGNMENTS:**
Before writing the story outline, list each character's historical role:
```
ROLES:
[Child Name]: [Historical Figure] ([their role in the event])
[Child Name]: [Historical Figure] ([their role in the event])
```

Example outputs:
- Moon landing: "ROLES:\nEmma: Neil Armstrong (first human to walk on the moon)\nMax: Mission Control Director (guides the mission from Houston)"
- Wright Brothers: "ROLES:\nSophie: Orville Wright (pilot of the first flight)\nMax: Wilbur Wright (runs alongside the plane)"
- Light bulb: "ROLES:\nEmma: Thomas Edison (inventor testing thousands of materials)"
- Pyramids: "ROLES:\nEmma: Imhotep (chief architect)\nMax: Foreman (organizes the workers)\nSophie: Engineer (solves construction puzzles)"

IMPORTANT:
- List ALL main characters with their assigned historical roles FIRST
- Then write the story outline
- Each main character needs a meaningful role in the achievement
- Supporting characters can take secondary roles (assistants, family, witnesses)

STORY 2 REQUIREMENTS (OBSERVER - characters WITNESS the event):
The main characters witness the historical event unfold - they are observers, not the famous figures.
They experience history from the sidelines as a child, neighbor, friend, helper, or curious onlooker.

Examples of observer roles:
- Moon landing: "Emma and Max watch the Moon landing on TV with their family, dreaming of becoming astronauts."
- Wright Brothers: "Sophie is a local child who watches two strange men testing flying machines on the beach."
- Light bulb: "Max is Edison's young assistant who fetches materials and witnesses the breakthrough."
- Pyramids: "Emma is a worker's daughter who sneaks onto the construction site and befriends the architect's son."

IMPORTANT:
- Characters observe, help, or are inspired by the historical figures
- They can interact with the event but don't replace the famous people
- Focus on the child's perspective and what they learn/experience
