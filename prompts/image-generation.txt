CHILDREN'S BOOK ILLUSTRATION - Safe, family-friendly content.

**STYLE: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}**

**REFERENCE HANDLING:**
- Transform real photos into the art style (NOT photo-realistic)
- Characters must remain RECOGNIZABLE (same face, hair color, age, build)
- Use EXACTLY the clothing shown in reference images
- ALL characters in consistent style
- For element references (animals, objects): match EXACT appearance from reference

**COMPOSITION (CRITICAL):**
- RESPECT exact spatial positions described in the scene (left edge, right edge, center, etc.)
- For wide shots: characters should appear SMALL in frame with significant empty space between them
- If scene describes distance between characters: show them FAR APART, not close together
- Empty space is a compositional element - preserve it as described
- "Left/right edge" means AT THE EDGE of the frame, not near center
