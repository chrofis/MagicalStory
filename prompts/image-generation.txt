**STYLE: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}**

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS - transform into the art style
- Characters must remain RECOGNIZABLE (hair color, face shape, age, gender)
- Render in artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters in the SAME consistent style
- Character CLOTHING: Use EXACTLY what is shown in the reference images (the correct outfit has been pre-selected)

**COMPOSITION (CRITICAL):**
- RESPECT exact spatial positions described in the scene (left edge, right edge, center, etc.)
- For wide shots: characters should appear SMALL in frame with significant empty space between them
- If scene describes distance between characters: show them FAR APART, not close together
- Empty space is a compositional element - preserve it as described
- "Left/right edge" means AT THE EDGE of the frame, not near center
- IGNORE any metric distances (meters, feet) or percentages if present in scene description
- Interpret closeness: "arm's reach" = close together, "far apart" = opposite sides of frame
- Frame regions: "left edge" = very left, "left side" = left third, "center" = middle, "right side" = right third

**IDENTITY PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):**
Each character MUST be the SAME PERSON as shown in their reference image.
Preserve exact: eye shape, nose, jawline, and facial proportions from reference.
Do not average or blend features - replicate the exact face.
