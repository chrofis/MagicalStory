Create a **cinematic scene** in {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}. Use professional photography/cinematography techniques, focusing on lighting, composition, and depth of field to create a visually striking image.

Scene Description: {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}
{CHARACTER_PROMPTS}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION - CRITICAL:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style ({STYLE_DESCRIPTION})
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE as the same person (same hair color, face shape, age, gender, distinguishing features)
- But rendered in the artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

**CLOTHING & APPEARANCE:**
- Character FACES, HAIR, and BODY PROPORTIONS must match reference images exactly
- Clothing should be APPROPRIATE TO THE SCENE CONTEXT:
  - Winter/snow scenes → warm clothing (coats, boots, hats)
  - Beach/summer scenes → light clothing (shorts, dresses, sandals)
  - Formal events → dressy attire
  - Bedtime scenes → pajamas
- Maintain consistent COLOR PREFERENCES when adapting clothing (if character wears blue in reference, use blue tones)
- Signature accessories (glasses, favorite hat, necklace) should remain consistent across scenes

Important:
- Focus on a **clear, uncluttered composition** that highlights the main subjects and action
- Capture the emotion and narrative of the scene vividly
- **No text, watermarks, or extraneous elements** should be present in the image
- Do not add objects or details not explicitly mentioned in the scene description or character prompts
