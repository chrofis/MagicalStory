Create a **cinematic scene** in {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}. Use professional photography/cinematography techniques, focusing on lighting, composition, and depth of field to create a visually striking image.

Scene Description: {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}
{CHARACTER_PROMPTS}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION - CRITICAL:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style ({STYLE_DESCRIPTION})
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE as the same person (same hair color, face shape, age, gender, distinguishing features)
- But rendered in the artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

Important:
- Keep clothing as described, adapted to the art style
- Focus on a **clear, uncluttered composition** that highlights the main subjects and action
- Capture the emotion and narrative of the scene vividly
- **No text, watermarks, or extraneous elements** should be present in the image
- Do not add objects or details not explicitly mentioned in the scene description or character prompts
