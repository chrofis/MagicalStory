**STYLE: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}**

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS - transform into the art style
- Characters must remain RECOGNIZABLE (hair color, face shape, age, gender)
- Render in artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters in the SAME consistent style
- Character CLOTHING: Use EXACTLY what is shown in the reference images (the correct outfit has been pre-selected)

**COMPOSITION (CRITICAL):**
- RESPECT exact spatial positions described in the scene (left edge, right edge, center, etc.)
- For wide shots: characters should appear SMALL in frame with significant empty space between them
- If scene describes distance between characters: show them FAR APART, not close together
- Empty space is a compositional element - preserve it as described
- "Left/right edge" means AT THE EDGE of the frame, not near center
- IGNORE any metric distances (meters, feet) or percentages if present in scene description
- Interpret closeness: "arm's reach" = close together, "far apart" = opposite sides of frame
- Frame regions: "left edge" = very left, "left side" = left third, "center" = middle, "right side" = right third

{CHARACTER_REFERENCE_LIST}

**REFERENCE IMAGE USAGE (CRITICAL):**
- Reference photos are PROVIDED FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING ONLY
- DO NOT include reference photos, thumbnails, or numbered image grids in the generated image
- The output must be a SINGLE illustration showing ONLY the described scene
- Reference photos show what characters LOOK LIKE - use them to draw the characters accurately, but NEVER show the photos themselves

**IDENTITY PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):**
Each [Image N - Name] label above corresponds to the reference photo that follows it.
- COPY THE EXACT FACE from each labeled reference image
- Preserve: eye shape, nose, jawline, facial proportions, hair color/style
- Each character must look like the SAME PERSON as their reference - not similar, IDENTICAL
- Do NOT average or blend features between different characters
- For element references (animals, objects, artifacts): match the EXACT appearance from the reference
