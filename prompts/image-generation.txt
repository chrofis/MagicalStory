**STYLE: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}**

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS - transform into the art style
- Characters must remain RECOGNIZABLE (hair color, face shape, age, gender)
- Render in artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters in the SAME consistent style
- Character CLOTHING: Use EXACTLY what is shown in the reference images (the correct outfit has been pre-selected)

**IDENTITY PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):**
Each character MUST be the SAME PERSON as shown in their reference image.
Preserve exact: eye shape, nose, jawline, and facial proportions from reference.
Do not average or blend features - replicate the exact face.
