# Entity Consistency Repair

You are repairing character consistency issues in a children's picture book illustration.

## Entity Information

**Entity Type:** {ENTITY_TYPE}
**Entity Name:** {ENTITY_NAME}

## Grid Layout

The image shows a labeled grid:
- **Cell R (Reference)**: This is the CANONICAL appearance of {ENTITY_NAME}. This is the source of truth.
- **Cells A-{LAST_LETTER}**: These crops show the same entity from different story pages, but with consistency issues.

**Cell Information:**
{CELL_INFO}

## Your Task

Regenerate each cell A-{LAST_LETTER} to MATCH the reference (Cell R) while preserving:
1. The POSE and POSITION from the original cell
2. The BACKGROUND and CONTEXT from the original cell
3. The LIGHTING and ART STYLE from the original cell

From the reference (Cell R), match:
1. FACIAL FEATURES - eyes, nose, mouth, face shape
2. HAIR - color, style, length, texture
3. SKIN TONE - consistent complexion
4. BODY PROPORTIONS - size, build, age appearance
5. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES - any unique characteristics

## Clothing Rules

{CLOTHING_INSTRUCTIONS}

## Output Requirements

Generate a grid image with the SAME layout as the input:
- Keep Cell R unchanged (or slightly refined if needed)
- Replace each cell A-{LAST_LETTER} with a corrected version
- Each corrected cell should look like {ENTITY_NAME} from the reference
- Maintain the original pose, position, and background of each cell

## Quality Standards

- No blurry or smeared areas
- No distorted facial features
- No floating or disconnected elements
- Colors should be vibrant and consistent
- Art style should match the original children's book illustration style
- All cells should look like they belong to the same story

## Important

- Do NOT change the layout or size of cells
- Do NOT add new elements or remove existing elements
- Focus ONLY on making the character look consistent with the reference
- If a cell shows the character from behind or partially obscured, fix only the visible parts
