# Single Page Entity Repair

You are repairing character consistency in a children's picture book illustration.

## Input Images

**IMAGE 1 - CHARACTER REFERENCE:**
Shows the correct appearance of "{ENTITY_NAME}" in the art style of this book.

**IMAGE 2 - PAGE TO REPAIR:**
The illustration from page {PAGE_NUMBER} where "{ENTITY_NAME}" needs correction.

## Character Details

**Physical Traits:** {PHYSICAL_TRAITS}
**Clothing for this scene:** {CLOTHING_DESCRIPTION}

## CRITICAL: What You MUST Change

You MUST redraw "{ENTITY_NAME}" in IMAGE 2 to match IMAGE 1. The output MUST show visible differences from IMAGE 2 - specifically, the character's appearance MUST be corrected.

**REQUIRED CHANGES to "{ENTITY_NAME}":**
- FACE: Replace with the exact facial features from IMAGE 1 (eye shape, nose, mouth, face shape)
- HAIR: Change to exact color ({HAIR_COLOR}), style, and texture from IMAGE 1
- SKIN TONE: Correct to match the complexion in IMAGE 1
- BODY: Match the proportions and build shown in IMAGE 1

If the character in IMAGE 2 already looks identical to IMAGE 1, still regenerate the character to ensure consistency.

## What to Preserve

Keep the background, other characters, objects, lighting, and composition from IMAGE 2.
Do not crop or change the aspect ratio.

## Output Requirements

- Single image, same dimensions as IMAGE 2
- "{ENTITY_NAME}" MUST look noticeably different (corrected) compared to IMAGE 2
- Character should blend naturally with the preserved background
- Sharp edges, no blur or artifacts
- Maintain the children's book art style
