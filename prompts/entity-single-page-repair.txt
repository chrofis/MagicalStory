# Single Page Entity Repair

You are repairing character consistency in a children's picture book illustration.

## Input Images

**IMAGE 1 - REFERENCE GRID:**
Shows the correct appearance of "{ENTITY_NAME}":
- Cell R: The character's styled avatar (source of truth for appearance)
- Cells A-K: Other appearances from the same story with "{CLOTHING_CATEGORY}" clothing (for consistency reference)

**IMAGE 2 - REPAIR TARGET:**
The image from page {PAGE_NUMBER} that needs to be fixed.

## Your Task

Generate a repaired version of IMAGE 2 where "{ENTITY_NAME}" matches the reference appearance.

From the REFERENCE GRID (Cell R and other cells), match:
1. **FACIAL FEATURES** - eyes, nose, mouth, face shape, expression style
2. **HAIR** - exact color, style, length, texture
3. **SKIN TONE** - consistent complexion
4. **BODY PROPORTIONS** - size, build, age appearance
5. **DISTINCTIVE FEATURES** - any unique characteristics visible in references

From the REPAIR TARGET (IMAGE 2), PRESERVE:
1. **POSE and POSITION** of the character in the scene
2. **BACKGROUND and CONTEXT** - all scenery, objects, other characters
3. **LIGHTING and ART STYLE** - maintain the illustration style
4. **COMPOSITION** - keep framing and layout identical

## Clothing

The character should wear "{CLOTHING_CATEGORY}" clothing as shown in the reference grid.
Match the clothing style, colors, and details from the reference images.

## Output Requirements

Generate ONLY the repaired version of IMAGE 2 as a single image:
- Match the exact dimensions and aspect ratio of IMAGE 2
- Do NOT output a grid or multiple cells
- Do NOT change the background, other characters, or scene elements
- Focus ONLY on correcting the appearance of "{ENTITY_NAME}"

## Quality Standards

- No blurry or smeared areas
- No distorted facial features
- No floating or disconnected elements
- Colors should be vibrant and consistent with the art style
- The character should look like they belong in the scene
