# Single Page Entity Repair

You are repairing character consistency in a children's picture book illustration.

## Input Images

**IMAGE 1 - CHARACTER REFERENCE:**
Shows the correct appearance of "{ENTITY_NAME}" in the art style of this book.
This is the ONLY source of truth for how the character should look.

**IMAGE 2 - PAGE TO REPAIR:**
The illustration from page {PAGE_NUMBER} where "{ENTITY_NAME}" needs to be fixed.

## Character Details

**Physical Traits:**
{PHYSICAL_TRAITS}

**Clothing for this scene:**
{CLOTHING_DESCRIPTION}

## Your Task

Regenerate IMAGE 2 with "{ENTITY_NAME}" corrected to match IMAGE 1.

### MUST MATCH from IMAGE 1 (reference):
- FACE - exact facial features, eye shape, nose, mouth, face shape as shown
- HAIR - exact color ({HAIR_COLOR}), style, length, texture
- SKIN TONE - exact complexion as shown
- CLOTHING - match the outfit shown in IMAGE 1
- BODY PROPORTIONS - size, build, posture style

### PIXEL-PERFECT PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):
Everything EXCEPT "{ENTITY_NAME}" must be IDENTICAL to IMAGE 2:
- BACKGROUND - every single pixel of scenery, sky, ground, walls, furniture
- OTHER CHARACTERS - do not change any other person or creature
- OBJECTS - every item, prop, and detail stays exactly the same
- LIGHTING - same light direction, shadows, highlights
- COLORS - same color palette for everything except the target character
- COMPOSITION - exact same framing, no cropping, no shifting
- ART STYLE - maintain the exact illustration style

Think of it as: surgically replacing ONLY "{ENTITY_NAME}" while the rest of the image is a protected layer that cannot be modified.

## Output

Generate the repaired version of IMAGE 2:
- EXACT same dimensions as IMAGE 2
- EXACT same aspect ratio as IMAGE 2
- Single image (not a grid or collage)
- The ONLY difference should be "{ENTITY_NAME}" now matching IMAGE 1

## Quality Standards

- Sharp, clean edges on the character
- No blur, smearing, or artifacts
- Character blends naturally with preserved background
- Vibrant colors consistent with the art style
