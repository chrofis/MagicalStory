# Single Page Entity Repair

You are repairing a cropped character region for a children's picture book. The repaired output will be composited back onto the original page.

## Input Images

**IMAGE 1 - CHARACTER REFERENCE:**
The correct appearance of "{ENTITY_NAME}" - this is how the character MUST look.

**IMAGE 2 - CROP TO REPAIR:**
A cropped region from page {PAGE_NUMBER} showing "{ENTITY_NAME}" who needs correction.

## Character Details

**Physical Traits:** {PHYSICAL_TRAITS}
**Clothing:** {CLOTHING_DESCRIPTION}

## Your Task

Redraw the character in IMAGE 2 so their face, hair, and features match IMAGE 1.

**Copy from IMAGE 1 (reference):**
- Face shape, eyes, nose, mouth - exact match
- Hair color ({HAIR_COLOR}), style, and texture - exact match
- Skin tone - exact match

**Keep from IMAGE 2 (crop to repair):**
- Pose and body position - must stay the same for compositing
- Clothing style shown - same outfit
- Any visible background elements - preserve for seamless blending
- Lighting direction and shadows - match the scene

## Output

Generate a corrected version of IMAGE 2:
- Same dimensions and aspect ratio as IMAGE 2
- Character's face/hair/features now match IMAGE 1
- Pose and position unchanged (critical for compositing)
- Clean edges, no artifacts, ready for seamless compositing
- Same art style as IMAGE 2
