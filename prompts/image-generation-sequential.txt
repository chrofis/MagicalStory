Create a cinematic scene in {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}.

Scene Description: {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}

{CHARACTER_INFO}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION - CRITICAL:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style ({STYLE_DESCRIPTION})
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE as the same person (same hair color, face shape, age, gender, distinguishing features)
- But rendered in the artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

**CLOTHING & APPEARANCE:**
- Character FACES, HAIR, and BODY PROPORTIONS must match reference images exactly
- Clothing should be APPROPRIATE TO THE SCENE CONTEXT:
  - Winter/snow scenes → warm clothing (coats, boots, hats)
  - Beach/summer scenes → light clothing (shorts, dresses, sandals)
  - Formal events → dressy attire
  - Bedtime scenes → pajamas
- Maintain consistent COLOR PREFERENCES when adapting clothing (if character wears blue in reference, use blue tones)
- Signature accessories (glasses, favorite hat, necklace) should remain consistent across scenes

**VISUAL CONTINUITY:**
The FIRST attached image shows the PREVIOUS scene from this story. Maintain:
- Same character appearances as in the previous scene (they are already transformed to the art style)
- Consistent art style, lighting approach, and color palette
- Any recurring objects or background elements should look the same

Important:
- Show appropriate emotions on faces (happy, sad, surprised, worried, excited)
- Characters must be recognizable throughout the story
- Clean, clear composition
