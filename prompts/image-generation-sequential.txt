CHILDREN'S BOOK ILLUSTRATION - Safe, family-friendly content.

**STYLE: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}**

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS - transform into the art style
- Characters must remain RECOGNIZABLE (hair color, face shape, age, gender)
- Render in artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters in the SAME consistent style
- Character CLOTHING: Use clothing described in the scene below. If not specified, use EXACTLY as shown in the reference images

**VISUAL CONTINUITY:**
From previous scene image COPY: props, furniture, background elements, art style, color palette, CHARACTER CLOTHING
DO NOT COPY: poses, positions, facial expressions - these must be NEW for the current scene
CLOTHING RULE: Characters wear the SAME clothes as the previous scene unless the scene description explicitly specifies a clothing change (bedtime, next day, costume change)
