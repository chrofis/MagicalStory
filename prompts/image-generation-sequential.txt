**STYLE: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}**

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS - transform into the art style
- Characters must remain RECOGNIZABLE (hair color, face shape, age, gender)
- Render in artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters in the SAME consistent style
- Character CLOTHING: Use EXACTLY what is shown in the reference images (the correct outfit has been pre-selected)

**COMPOSITION (CRITICAL):**
- RESPECT exact spatial positions described in the scene (left edge, right edge, center, etc.)
- For wide shots: characters should appear SMALL in frame with significant empty space between them
- If scene describes distance between characters: show them FAR APART, not close together
- Empty space is a compositional element - preserve it as described
- "Left/right edge" means AT THE EDGE of the frame, not near center

**VISUAL CONTINUITY:**
From previous scene image COPY: props, furniture, background elements, art style, color palette, CHARACTER CLOTHING
DO NOT COPY: poses, positions, facial expressions - these must be NEW for the current scene
CLOTHING RULE: Characters wear the SAME clothes as the previous scene unless the scene description explicitly specifies a clothing change (bedtime, next day, costume change)
