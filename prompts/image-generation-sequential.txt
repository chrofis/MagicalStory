**STYLE: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}**

- For element references (animals, objects): match EXACT appearance from reference

**COMPOSITION (CRITICAL):**
- RESPECT exact spatial positions described in the scene (left edge, right edge, center, etc.)
- For wide shots: characters should appear SMALL in frame with significant empty space between them
- If scene describes distance between characters: show them FAR APART, not close together
- Empty space is a compositional element - preserve it as described
- "Left/right edge" means AT THE EDGE of the frame, not near center

**VISUAL CONTINUITY:**
From previous scene image COPY: props, furniture, background elements, art style, color palette, CHARACTER CLOTHING
DO NOT COPY: poses, positions, facial expressions - these must be NEW for the current scene
CLOTHING RULE: Characters wear the SAME clothes as the previous scene unless the scene description explicitly specifies a clothing change
