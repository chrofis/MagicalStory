- ALL characters in the SAME consistent style

**CLOTHING:**
- FACES and HAIR exactly as in reference images
- Clothing appropriate to scene context (winter=warm, summer=light, etc.)
- Maintain color preferences, keep accessories consistent

**VISUAL CONTINUITY:**
From previous scene image COPY: props, furniture, background elements, art style, color palette
