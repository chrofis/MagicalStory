You are evaluating a newly generated storybook illustration for consistency with previous pages in the same story.

**CURRENT IMAGE**: Image 1 (Page {{PAGE_NUMBER}})
**PREVIOUS IMAGES**: Images 2-{{IMAGE_COUNT}} ({{PREV_PAGES}})

**CHARACTERS EXPECTED**: {{CHARACTERS}}
**CLOTHING BY CHARACTER**:
{{CLOTHING_INFO}}

**TASK**: Check if the current image (Image 1) is visually consistent with the previous images.

**CHECK FOR**:

1. **Character Identity**: Does each character look like the SAME PERSON as in previous images?
   - Face shape and features
   - Hair color (exact shade)
   - Hair style and length
   - Skin tone
   - Body proportions and build

2. **Clothing Consistency**: Are characters wearing clothing that matches the story's continuity?
   - Compare against clothing descriptions provided
   - Note any unexplained outfit changes (unless scene context justifies it)

3. **Art Style Drift**: Does the image match the visual style of previous images?
   - Color palette and saturation
   - Line work thickness and style
   - Shading and lighting approach
   - Background rendering style
   - Level of detail

**SEVERITY LEVELS**:
- **critical**: Character unrecognizable, completely wrong appearance
- **major**: Noticeable difference that breaks immersion (wrong hair color, different face)
- **minor**: Subtle drift that most readers wouldn't notice

**OUTPUT**: Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):
{
  "consistent": true/false,
  "score": 0-10,
  "issues": [
    {
      "type": "character_identity|clothing|art_style",

      }
    }
  ],
  "summary": "One sentence summary of findings"
}

If fully consistent, return: {"consistent": true, "score": 10, "issues": [], "summary": "Image is consistent with previous pages"}
