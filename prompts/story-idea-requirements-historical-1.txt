--- STORY REQUIREMENTS (PARTICIPANT) ---

The main characters ARE the historical achievers - they perform the famous deeds themselves.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - MUST START WITH ROLE ASSIGNMENTS:**
Before writing the story outline, list each character's historical role:
```
ROLES:
[Child Name]: [Historical Figure] ([their role in the event])
[Child Name]: [Historical Figure] ([their role in the event])
```

Example outputs:
- Moon landing: "ROLES:\nEmma: Neil Armstrong (first human to walk on the moon)\nMax: Mission Control Director (guides the mission from Houston)"
- Wright Brothers: "ROLES:\nSophie: Orville Wright (pilot of the first flight)\nMax: Wilbur Wright (runs alongside the plane)"
- Light bulb: "ROLES:\nEmma: Thomas Edison (inventor testing thousands of materials)"
- Pyramids: "ROLES:\nEmma: Imhotep (chief architect)\nMax: Foreman (organizes the workers)\nSophie: Engineer (solves construction puzzles)"

IMPORTANT:
- List ALL main characters with their assigned historical roles FIRST
- Then write the story outline
- Each main character needs a meaningful role in the achievement
- Supporting characters can take secondary roles (assistants, family, witnesses)
