- Transform these people into the requested art style
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE but in the artistic style
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

**CHARACTER COMPOSITION - CRITICAL:**
- Include ALL characters from the story in this image
- The MAIN CHARACTER should be positioned in the CENTER of the group
- All other characters should be arranged AROUND the main character
- Everyone should be clearly visible and recognizable
- This is a GROUP scene that introduces all the story's characters together

IMPORTANT:
- This image should contain NO TEXT at all
- Create a purely visual, atmospheric illustration that sets the mood for the story
- Focus on creating an inviting, warm scene that draws the reader in
