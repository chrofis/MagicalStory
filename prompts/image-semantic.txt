Check if this illustration matches what was requested.

**SCENE_HINT (what image should show):** "{SCENE_HINT}"
**STORY_TEXT (narrative context):** "{STORY_TEXT}"

---

**STEP 1: DESCRIBE WHAT'S VISIBLE**

List everything you see in the image:
- Characters (who, appearance, position, what they're doing)
- Objects (items being held, used, or prominent in scene)
- Setting/background (location, landmarks)
- Action (what's happening)

---

**STEP 2: COMPARE TO SCENE_HINT**

Check if the image matches what was requested:
- Are all mentioned characters present?
- Are all mentioned objects present?
- Is the setting/location correct?
- Is the action correct? (who's doing what to whom)

---

**SCORING**

Start at 10, subtract for issues:
- Missing character: -3 (CRITICAL)
- Missing key object: -2 (MAJOR)
- Wrong/missing setting: -2 (MAJOR)
- Action reversed or wrong: -2 (MAJOR)
- Missing background element: -1 (MINOR)

VERDICT: PASS (7+), FAIL (0-6)
