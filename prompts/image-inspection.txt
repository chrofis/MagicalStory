Analyze this children's book illustration for physics and visual errors.

**SPECIFICALLY CHECK FOR:**

1. **Slack ropes/strings**: Ropes, strings, or cords that should be taut but appear loose, wavy, or sagging when being pulled or held tight

2. **Hand-object fusion**: Hands merging into objects they're holding with no clear boundary between skin and object material

3. **Wrong facing direction**: Characters facing the camera/viewer when the scene context suggests they should be facing away (e.g., running away, leaving, watching something in the distance)

4. **Gravity violations**: Heavy objects not causing visible strain on the holder, floating items that should fall, objects defying physics

5. **Anatomical errors**: Extra/missing fingers (not exactly 5 per hand), extra/missing limbs, arms or legs at impossible angles

6. **Material boundary issues**: Two touching objects with unclear separation (e.g., where does the sword end and the hand begin?)

**OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):**

If error found, return:
```json
{
  "error_found": true,
  "error_type": "slack_rope" | "hand_fusion" | "wrong_facing" | "gravity" | "anatomy" | "material_boundary",
  "description": "Brief description of what's wrong",
  "bounding_box": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax],
  "fix_prompt": "Specific instruction to fix this error"
}
```

If NO error found, return:
```json
{
  "error_found": false
}
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Bounding box coordinates are normalized 0-1000 (relative to image dimensions)
  - Example: [250, 100, 750, 400] means top-left at 25% down/10% right, bottom-right at 75% down/40% right
- Only report the SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT error if multiple exist
- Be CONSERVATIVE - only flag CLEAR physics/visual violations
- Artistic style choices are NOT errors (e.g., stylized proportions, cartoon physics that's intentional)
- This is a children's book - minor imperfections are acceptable if the overall image works

**FIX PROMPT EXAMPLES:**

- For slack rope: "Make the rope taut and straight, pulled tight with visible tension"
- For wrong facing: "Turn the character around to show their back, facing away from the viewer"
- For hand fusion: "Add clear separation between the hand and the [object], showing distinct skin and [material] textures"
- For anatomy: "Correct the hand to show exactly 5 fingers"
- For gravity: "Show the character straining under the weight, with bent knees and visible effort"
