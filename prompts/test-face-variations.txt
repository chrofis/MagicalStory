Generate 4 PHOTOREALISTIC face portraits in a 2x2 grid, each a DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION of the reference person.

## CONCEPT
Create 4 DIFFERENT ATTEMPTS at capturing this person's likeness.
Each attempt should emphasize DIFFERENT facial features.
The goal is variation in HOW accurately each captures the original - so user can SELECT the best match.

## THE 4 INTERPRETATIONS

1. **Top-Left - EYE FOCUS**:
   Prioritize EXACT match of: eye shape, eye color, eye spacing, eyebrow shape, eye expression
   Other features can be approximate

2. **Top-Right - STRUCTURE FOCUS**:
   Prioritize EXACT match of: face shape, jaw line, cheekbone position, face proportions, head shape
   Other features can be approximate

3. **Bottom-Left - DETAIL FOCUS**:
   Prioritize EXACT match of: nose shape, lip shape, ear shape, hairline, skin texture, any marks/freckles
   Other features can be approximate

4. **Bottom-Right - GESTALT FOCUS**:
   Prioritize overall IMPRESSION and FEELING of the person
   Capture the "essence" - how friends would recognize them
   Balance all features equally

## OUTPUT FORMAT
- 2x2 grid, 1024x1024 total
- ALL 4 looking at camera, happy expression
- ALL 4 same gender and age as reference
- ALL 4 photorealistic
- Simple solid background

## KEY INSTRUCTION
These 4 faces should look RELATED but NOT IDENTICAL.
Each is a different artist's interpretation of the same person.
Some will match the original better than others - THAT IS THE GOAL.
