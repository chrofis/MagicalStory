Generate 4 PHOTOREALISTIC portraits of THE SAME PERSON from the reference photo in a 2x2 grid.

## CONCEPT
Create 4 photos of THE EXACT SAME CHILD/PERSON from the reference image.
These should look like 4 different photos taken of the SAME person on different days.
ALL 4 must be immediately recognizable as the person in the reference photo.
The subtle variations are natural - like how anyone looks slightly different in different photos.

## IDENTITY PRESERVATION (CRITICAL - match the reference photo)
You MUST preserve these features EXACTLY from the reference:
- Face shape and proportions
- Eye shape, size, color, and spacing
- Nose shape and size
- Mouth and lip shape
- Ear shape and position
- Hairline shape
- Skin tone and any freckles/marks
- Overall facial structure and bone structure

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Create a 2x2 GRID with 4 PHOTOREALISTIC FACE PORTRAITS:
- ALL 4 looking DIRECTLY AT CAMERA (frontal view)
- ALL 4 with similar HAPPY expression (friendly smile)
- ALL 4 in FULL COLOR
- ALL 4 must look like THE SAME PERSON as the reference

## THE 4 VARIATIONS (very subtle, natural differences)
Like photos taken on different days - same person, tiny natural variations:
1. Top-Left: Direct match to reference - neutral happy expression
2. Top-Right: Same person - slightly wider smile, eyes slightly more open
3. Bottom-Left: Same person - subtle head tilt (still frontal), relaxed smile
4. Bottom-Right: Same person - biggest smile, showing teeth

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- ALL 4 faces must be IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZABLE as the reference person
- This is the SAME PERSON in all 4 photos, NOT siblings or relatives
- Variations are ONLY in expression and lighting, NOT in facial features
- PHOTOREALISTIC - must look like real photographs
- Head and shoulders framing
- Clean, simple background (solid pastel or soft gradient)
- Professional portrait photography quality
