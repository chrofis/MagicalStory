Generate 4 PHOTOREALISTIC face variations of this person in a 2x2 grid.

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Create a 2x2 GRID with 4 PHOTOREALISTIC FACE PORTRAITS:
- ALL 4 must show the face looking DIRECTLY AT CAMERA (frontal view)
- ALL 4 must be the SAME person with IDENTICAL features
- ALL 4 must have the SAME HAPPY expression (friendly, approachable)

## THE 4 VARIATIONS
All faces should look HAPPY and FRIENDLY. The only differences are subtle lighting:
1. Top-Left: Happy expression, soft frontal studio lighting
2. Top-Right: Happy expression, warm golden lighting from upper-left
3. Bottom-Left: Happy expression, natural outdoor daylight (MUST BE FULL COLOR)
4. Bottom-Right: Happy expression, bright even studio lighting

IMPORTANT: ALL 4 images must be in FULL COLOR. No grayscale or black-and-white.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- PHOTOREALISTIC - must look like real photographs
- ALL faces looking FORWARD at camera - NO profiles, NO 3/4 views
- ALL faces with SAME HAPPY EMOTION - no sad, neutral, or varied expressions
- SAME face shape, hair color, eye color, skin tone in all 4
- Head and shoulders framing
- Clean, simple background (solid color or soft gradient)
- Professional portrait photography quality
- PRESERVE THE PERSON'S IDENTITY exactly as in the reference photo
