TASK: Create a 2x2 Character Concept Design Sheet / Orthographic Views. Use a GRID IMAGE with 4 views of the EXACT individual from the reference photos.

OUTPUT STYLE: PHOTOREALISTIC - This must look like a professional fashion photograph, NOT a cartoon, NOT animated, NOT Pixar style.

GRID LAYOUT (with clear black dividing lines between quadrants):
- TOP LEFT: Face - Front (looking at camera)
- TOP RIGHT: Face - 3/4 Profile (75° looking RIGHT)
- BOTTOM LEFT: Full Body - Front View (facing camera)
- BOTTOM RIGHT: Full Body - Profile View (facing RIGHT)

GRID REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean 2x2 collage layout with a thin neutral divider.
- Both profile views (top right and bottom right) face towards the RIGHT
- Each quadrant has solid light grey (off-white) studio background
- All 4 quadrants show the SAME outfit. Patterns/logos must be identical in size, color, and placement.

VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Face: 100% identical to reference photo. Direct replication, not averaged.
- Body: Generate age-appropriate body proportions based on apparent age in reference.
- Setting: Pure clean white background (#FFFFFF) in each quadrant.
- Lighting: Natural, even, studio-style diffused light.
- Top quadrants: FACE ONLY - forehead to chin. NO shoulders, NO neck, NO clothing visible. Tight crop on face.
- Bottom quadrants: Full body, head to toe. Shoes visible.

BODY TRANSFORMATION:
- Generate the person with an ATHLETIC, FIT body type by default
- Do NOT preserve overweight or heavy body proportions from the reference photo
- Keep the EXACT same face and identity, but transform the body to be slim and athletic
- For children: fit and healthy, age-appropriate athletic proportions

IDENTITY PERSISTENCE:
- Hair and face must be fully visible. Avoid hats and hoods.
- Biometric precision: The face must not be averaged or replaced.
- Focus: Ultra-sharp focus on facial features.
- Enforce age-accurate head-to-body ratio (Infant=4, Child=6, Teen=7, Adult=8)
