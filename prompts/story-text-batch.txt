Based on this outline:

{OUTLINE}

Now write the complete story text with full narrative details, descriptions, and dialogue for PAGES {START_PAGE} through {END_PAGE} ONLY.

CRITICAL: You MUST preserve ALL page markers exactly as they appear in the outline:
- Keep all "## Seite X" or "## Page X" headers for pages {START_PAGE}-{END_PAGE}
- Keep all "---" separators between pages
- {INCLUDE_TITLE}
- Write ONLY pages {START_PAGE} through {END_PAGE}

Write the full story content for each page in this range, but maintain the exact page structure from the outline.
