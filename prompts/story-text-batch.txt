Your task is to create a complete, compelling, well-structured story.

{BASE_PROMPT}

Here is the story outline:
{OUTLINE}

IMPORTANT: Now write pages {START_PAGE} through {END_PAGE} of the story following the outline above.
If `{INCLUDE_TITLE}` is set to TRUE, provide a catchy, age-appropriate title at the very beginning of the first page you write (Page {START_PAGE}).
Assume the story has progressed up to Page {START_PAGE - 1} and seamlessly continue the narrative from that point.

You **MUST** write exactly pages {START_PAGE} through {END_PAGE}.
**Do NOT stop** until all pages in this range are complete.
Ensure there is **exactly one "--- Page X ---" marker per page**.
Write engaging, age-appropriate content for each page, maintaining a consistent narrative voice and tone.
Ensure all characters consistently reflect their established traits, ages, and relationships from the BASE_PROMPT.
Within this page range, ensure the plot progresses naturally and avoids rushing or excessive detail on any single page.

FORMATTING: Format dialogues inline within paragraphs.
**Do not add extra line breaks** between dialogue lines.
Keep conversations flowing in continuous prose like a traditional novel.

Output Format:
--- Page {START_PAGE} ---
[Story text for page {START_PAGE}...]

--- Page X ---
[Story text...]

...continue until page {END_PAGE}...
