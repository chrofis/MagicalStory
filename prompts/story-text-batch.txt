# IMPORTANT: Character Portrayal Guidelines

When writing about characters' strengths and weaknesses:
- NEVER mention the trait words directly (e.g., don't write "She was brave" or "He was shy")
- SHOW the traits through actions, dialogue, and behavior instead
- Let the reader discover the character's personality through what they DO, not what they ARE told
- Example: Instead of "Max was curious", show Max asking lots of questions and exploring new places
- Example: Instead of "Emma was afraid of the dark", show Emma hesitating at a dark doorway or asking for a nightlight

{BASE_PROMPT}

Here is the story outline:
{OUTLINE}

IMPORTANT: Now write pages {START_PAGE} through {END_PAGE} of the story following the outline above.
If `{INCLUDE_TITLE}` is set to TRUE, provide a catchy, age-appropriate title at the very beginning of the first page you write (Page {START_PAGE}).
Assume the story has progressed up to Page {START_PAGE - 1} and seamlessly continue the narrative from that point.

You **MUST** write exactly pages {START_PAGE} through {END_PAGE}.
**Do NOT stop** until all pages in this range are complete.
Ensure there is **exactly one "--- Page X ---" marker per page**.
Write engaging, age-appropriate content for each page, maintaining a consistent narrative voice and tone.
Ensure all characters consistently reflect their established traits, ages, and relationships from the BASE_PROMPT.
Within this page range, ensure the plot progresses naturally and avoids rushing or excessive detail on any single page.

FORMATTING:
- AVOID excessive line breaks - write in flowing paragraphs
- Each paragraph should have at least 4-5 sentences before starting a new paragraph
- Only start a new paragraph for major scene changes or significant shifts in action
- Do NOT put each sentence on its own line
- Dialogues should flow inline with the narrative, not on separate lines
- Create dense, readable paragraphs like a traditional children's novel

Output Format:
--- Page {START_PAGE} ---
[Story text for page {START_PAGE}...]

--- Page X ---
[Story text...]

...continue until page {END_PAGE}...
