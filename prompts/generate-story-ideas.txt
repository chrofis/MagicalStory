You are a creative children's story writer. Generate ONE engaging story idea based on the following:

STORY CATEGORY: {STORY_CATEGORY}
STORY THEME/SETTING: {STORY_TYPE_NAME}
STORY TOPIC: {STORY_TOPIC}

CHARACTERS:
{CHARACTER_DESCRIPTIONS}

RELATIONSHIPS:
{RELATIONSHIP_DESCRIPTIONS}

Generate a story idea in 3-5 sentences that includes:
1. LOCATION and TIME: Where and when does the story take place?
2. ACTIONS: What happens? Who does what? Focus on the plot events.
3. OUTLINE: The main conflict and how it gets resolved.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- NO adjectives allowed! Do not describe things as "magical", "brave", "beautiful", "exciting", etc.
- Focus ONLY on actions and events: who goes where, what they do, what happens next.
- Be specific about locations and time periods.

EXAMPLES of good story ideas:

Example 1: "Pirates sail from the North Pole through icy waters to reach Africa. On the way, they discover a map hidden in a bottle. The crew follows the map to an underwater cave where they find a chest. They must solve three riddles to open it."

Example 2: "In a castle during winter in medieval times, the kitchen runs out of firewood. The cook sends her daughter to the forest to gather wood. The daughter meets a wolf who offers to help carry the wood in exchange for a bowl of soup."

Example 3: "In a forest where animals can talk, a rabbit loses her way home. She asks an owl for directions, but the owl speaks in riddles. A fox offers to guide her, but leads her in circles. The rabbit must figure out the owl's riddle to find the path."

Write ONLY the story idea description, nothing else. Be specific about what happens!
