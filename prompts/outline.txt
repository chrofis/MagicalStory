For EACH of the {PAGES} story pages, provide a SHORT SCENE DESCRIPTION (1-2 sentences) that describes the visual scene - what the characters are doing, where they are, and the setting. This will be used for illustration purposes.

In addition to the {PAGES} story pages, provide scene descriptions for these 3 cover elements:

**Page 0 Scene**: A dedication/introduction page illustration that creates a warm, inviting entry into the story world. This sets the mood and welcomes readers.

**Back Cover Scene**: A satisfying concluding illustration that provides closure and leaves readers with a positive feeling. This should feel like a natural ending to the visual journey.

...and so on for all {PAGES} pages.
