# Story Category Guidelines

{CATEGORY_GUIDELINES}

# TEXT LENGTH RULES - CRITICAL

**{READING_LEVEL}**

You MUST follow these text length guidelines strictly. Each page's story text must match the reading level specified above. The scene descriptions will be separate from the text, so plan accordingly.

# IMPORTANT: Character Portrayal Guidelines

- Write in third person (he/she/they)

When writing about characters' strengths and weaknesses:
- NEVER mention the trait words directly (e.g., don't write "She was brave" or "He was shy")
- SHOW the traits through actions, dialogue, and behavior instead
- Let the reader discover the character's personality through what they DO, not what they ARE told
- Example: Instead of "Max was curious", show Max asking lots of questions and exploring new places
- Example: Instead of "Emma was afraid of the dark", show Emma hesitating at a dark doorway or asking for a nightlight

# Part 1: Title

## Story Title
Create an engaging, age-appropriate title for this story. The title should:
- Capture the essence of the story
- Be appealing to the target age group
- Be memorable and creative
- Reflect the main theme or adventure

Format:
Title: [Your creative title here]

# Part 2: Visual Bible (for Illustration Consistency)

List ALL recurring visual elements that appear in MORE THAN ONE scene. This ensures consistent illustrations throughout the book.

**Why this matters:** Each illustration is generated independently. Without detailed descriptions, a white cat in scene 3 might become a brown cat in scene 8. The Visual Bible ensures consistency.

**DO NOT include main characters here.** The characters listed in the "Characters" section above ({CHARACTER_NAMES}) are already tracked separately with their reference photos. The Visual Bible is ONLY for NEW elements not already provided.

## Secondary Characters
For each person who is NOT listed in the "Characters" section above but appears in multiple scenes (e.g., a shopkeeper, a teacher, a neighbor):
- **Name/Role**: How they are referred to (e.g., "Fireman Fred" or "the friendly firefighter")
- **Appears in pages**: List all page numbers
- **Visual Appearance** (describe what the eye SEES, not backstory):
  - Apparent age: infant/baby (0-1) | toddler (1-2) | preschooler (3-4) | kindergartner (5-6) | young school-age child (7-8) | school-age child (9-10) | preteen (11-12) | young teen (13-14) | teenager (15-17) | young adult (18-25) | adult (26-39) | middle-aged (40-59) | senior (60-75) | elderly (75+)
  - Build/size: use standalone terms (short, average, tall, slim, stocky, muscular) - NO comparisons to other characters
  - Hair: color, style, length, facial hair (ONLY for adults - teens/children cannot have beards)
  - Face: eye color, skin tone, 1-2 distinctive features (scar, glasses, freckles)
- **Signature Look** (ONE memorable visual element for instant recognition, e.g., "bright red bandana", "gold tooth", "curved wooden cane")
- **Clothing**: Specific colors and details (be consistent across all scenes)

**IMPORTANT for Secondary Characters**:
- NEVER reference or compare to main characters (e.g., don't write "taller than Max" or "similar to Emma")
- Use the apparent age categories above (e.g., "teenager", "young adult", "middle-aged") - you may add specific ages for clarity (e.g., "teenager, around 16")
- Ensure features match the age category (no beards on children/teens, no wrinkles on young adults)
- The Signature Look should be visually striking and easy for AI to reproduce consistently
- Each description must be SELF-CONTAINED - readable without knowing who the main characters are

## Animals & Creatures
For any animal or creature appearing in multiple scenes:
- **Name**: What it's called (e.g., "Whiskers" or "the family cat")
- **Appears in pages**: List all page numbers
- **Species**: Type of animal/creature
- **Coloring**: Exact colors and patterns (e.g., "white fur with orange patches on both ears")
- **Size**: Relative size description
- **Distinguishing features**: Collar, markings, accessories

## Important Artifacts
For objects that appear in multiple scenes and must look consistent:
- **Name**: What it's called (e.g., "the magic map" or "grandma's locket")
- **Appears in pages**: List all page numbers
- **Type**: What kind of object
- **Description**: Size, color, material, condition, distinctive markings

## Locations
Every scene must have a location. List all locations:
- **Name**: What it's called (e.g., "Emma's house", "the town square", "the old bridge")
- **Appears in pages**: List all page numbers
- **Key visual features**: Be SPECIFIC about colors and distinctive details:
  - Building colors (e.g., "bright yellow house with red shutters", "grey stone church with green copper roof")
  - Architectural style (e.g., "Victorian with ornate balcony", "modern glass facade")
  - Memorable landmark element (e.g., "crooked chimney", "round window like a porthole", "wooden door with heart-shaped knocker")
- **Signature Element**: ONE unique visual detail that makes this location instantly recognizable (e.g., "the bright purple mailbox out front", "the weathervane shaped like a rooster")

## Vehicles & Transportation
For any vehicles appearing in multiple scenes:
- **Name/Type**: What it is (e.g., "Dad's car", "the school bus", "grandpa's bicycle")
- **Appears in pages**: List all page numbers
- **Color & Details**: Exact colors and distinctive features (e.g., "rusty red pickup truck with dented fender", "shiny blue bicycle with white basket", "yellow school bus with number 42")
- **Signature Element**: ONE memorable detail for recognition (e.g., "fuzzy dice hanging from mirror", "flower stickers on the basket")

## IMPORTANT: Visual Consistency Rules

**Every recurring element MUST have:**
1. **Specific colors** - Never say "a car" or "a house". Always specify: "a bright red car", "a pale blue house with white trim"
2. **One memorable signature element** - Something unique and easy to recognize that AI can reproduce consistently
3. **Enough detail for independent illustration** - Each description must work standalone without seeing other scenes

**Examples of GOOD descriptions:**
- "A cozy cottage with moss-green walls, a thatched roof, and a bright orange door with a brass cat-shaped knocker"
- "An old-fashioned red bicycle with a wicker basket and a silver bell on the handlebar"

**Examples of BAD descriptions (too vague):**
- "A house" ❌
- "A nice car" ❌
- "The school" ❌

**NOTE:** Only include elements that appear in 2+ scenes. Never include {CHARACTER_NAMES} here - they are main characters with reference photos.

# Part 3: Cover Scene Descriptions

In addition to the {PAGES} story pages, provide SIMPLE scene descriptions for these 3 cover elements.

**IMPORTANT RULES FOR COVER SCENES:**
- Keep descriptions SHORT (2-3 sentences max)
- Focus on MOOD and SETTING, not precise character positions
- Do NOT specify exact locations of each character
- Do NOT include text instructions (title, dedication, website - these are added separately)
- Do NOT over-specify details like weather effects, lighting, or props
- Let the AI image generator handle composition

**Title Page Scene**: A simple, striking scene featuring the MAIN CHARACTER prominently. Describe the mood, setting, and what the main character is doing. Keep supporting characters minimal or in background. (2-3 sentences)

**Initial Scene**: A warm group scene showing all characters together in a welcoming setting. Focus on the overall mood and atmosphere. (2-3 sentences)

**Back Cover Scene**: A satisfying conclusion scene with all characters together, feeling happy/content. Focus on emotional closure. (2-3 sentences)

---

# Part 4: Plot Structure

Create a detailed {PAGES}-page story outline with a compelling plot. The focus of the plot must be on the main character(s).
Clearly define:

**Inciting Incident**: The event that disrupts the ordinary world and sets the story in motion.

**Rising Action**: The series of events that build tension and develop conflict. Include obstacles, challenges, and complications the characters must face.

**Climax**: The turning point - the moment of highest tension where the main conflict reaches its peak.

**Falling Action**: Events following the climax that begin to resolve the conflict.

For longer stories with more than 15 scenes, include repeated rising actions, climax and falling actions. Ideally for multiple characters, especially if there is more than one main character.

**Resolution**: How the story concludes - the new normal after the adventure, showing character growth and lessons learned.

## Themes
Identify 2-3 major themes the story will explore that are appropriate for the target age group (e.g., friendship, courage, kindness, family, perseverance, overcoming fears, honesty).

## Tone and Genre
Describe the overall tone (e.g., adventurous, heartwarming, playful, magical) and genre elements that will shape the storytelling.

## Clothing Continuity

Determine the PRIMARY clothing context for the story based on the overall setting and adventure type:

**Primary Clothing:** [winter | summer | formal | standard]
- This is the DEFAULT clothing for all scenes unless a change is explicitly needed

**Clothing Change Events:** List any pages where clothing CHANGES and why:
- Only mark changes for: going to bed/waking up, major time skip (next day/season), explicit costume change in story, moving between drastically different environments (beach → snowy mountain)
- Moving between similar environments does NOT require a change (meadow → forest → river = same clothing)

Example:
- Primary Clothing: summer (outdoor summer adventure)
- Changes: Page 8 (bedtime scene → standard), Page 9 (next morning, back outside → summer)

---

# Part 5: Character Development Arcs

For EACH main character provided, detail their development arc by describing:

**Starting Point**: How they are at the beginning of the story (based on their traits - strengths, weaknesses, fears).

**Key Challenges**: Specific conflicts or obstacles they face that drive their development. Reference which pages/events in the outline these occur.

**Turning Points**: Realizations or moments of growth they experience. Link these directly to plot points and page numbers.

**End State**: How they have changed or evolved by the end of the story. What have they learned? How have they grown?

**Key Moments**: List 2-3 specific pages where this character's development is most evident.


For all other characters:
**Starting Point**: In which scene do they enter the story. Do not have all characters start on scene 1.
**Repeated behaviors**: Things they do repeatedly in the story that are characteristic for them.
**Challenge**: One challenge / scene where the character shines.

---

# Part 6: Page-by-Page Breakdown

For EACH of the {PAGES} story pages, provide:

**Key Action/Plot Point**: A sentence or two describing the main event or plot progression for that page.

**Character Focus**: Which character(s) are featured, their detailed actions, and how their traits/development are shown (remember: SHOW don't TELL)

**Scene**: One sentence describing the key visual moment for the illustrator.

**Clothing**: Use the PRIMARY clothing from "Clothing Continuity" section above, unless this page has a clothing change event.
- Write **[same]** if clothing matches the previous page
- Write **[change to: winter|summer|formal|standard]** if clothing changes, with brief reason

---

# CRITICAL: You MUST generate ALL 6 sections

**You MUST complete ALL sections listed above:**
1. Title
2. Visual Bible (with all subsections)
3. Cover Scenes (all 3: Title Page, Initial Page, Back Cover)
4. Plot Structure (with Themes, Tone, and Clothing Continuity)
5. Character Development Arcs (for ALL characters)
6. Page-by-Page Breakdown (for ALL {PAGES} pages, from Page 1 to Page {PAGES})

**DO NOT STOP EARLY.** The outline is incomplete unless it contains detailed breakdowns for every single page from 1 to {PAGES}.
