# Story Parameters

- **Title**: {TITLE}

# IMPORTANT: Character Portrayal Guidelines

When writing about characters' strengths and weaknesses:
- NEVER mention the trait words directly (e.g., don't write "She was brave" or "He was shy")
- SHOW the traits through actions, dialogue, and behavior instead
- Let the reader discover the character's personality through what they DO, not what they ARE told
- Example: Instead of "Max was curious", show Max asking lots of questions and exploring new places
- Example: Instead of "Emma was afraid of the dark", show Emma hesitating at a dark doorway or asking for a nightlight

# Part 1: Plot Structure

## Plot Structure
Create a detailed {PAGES}-page story outline with a compelling plot. Clearly define:

**Climax**: The turning point - the moment of highest tension where the main conflict reaches its peak.

**Falling Action**: Events following the climax that begin to resolve the conflict.

**Resolution**: How the story concludes - the new normal after the adventure, showing character growth and lessons learned.

## Themes
Identify 2-3 major themes the story will explore that are appropriate for the target age group (e.g., friendship, courage, kindness, family, perseverance, accepting differences, overcoming fears).

## Tone and Genre
Describe the overall tone (e.g., adventurous, heartwarming, playful, magical) and genre elements that will shape the storytelling.

**Turning Points**: Realizations or moments of growth they experience. Link these directly to plot points and page numbers.

**End State**: How they have changed or evolved by the end of the story. What have they learned? How have they grown?
