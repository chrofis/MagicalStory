# Clothing Avatar Generation Prompts

## Overview
This file contains prompts for generating character avatars in different clothing styles.
These avatars are used as reference images during story illustration generation.

## Base Prompt Template

```
Subject: Generate a fashion photograph of the person in the reference images.

CRITICAL PRIORITIES (in order):
1. FACE IDENTITY: The face MUST be an exact match to the reference photo - same facial features,
   skin tone, eye color, hair color and style. This is non-negotiable.
2. CLOTHING STYLE TRANSFER: The main clothing piece MUST inherit the pattern, texture, colors,
   and fabric style from the reference image. Apply these visual elements to the new garment type.

COMPOSITION:
- Framing: Wide shot. The entire outfit must be visible from head to toe.
- Background: Pure solid white background (#FFFFFF).

WARDROBE DETAILS:
- Style Transfer Rule: Whatever pattern, texture, or colors the person wears in the reference
  image, apply those SAME visual elements to the outfit below.
- Outfit: {CLOTHING_STYLE}

PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE:
- Style: High-End Editorial Photography.
- Lighting: Soft, evenly diffused studio lighting.
- Details: Sharp focus on fabric textures.
- Presentation: Clean, professional, magazine-quality look.

Output Quality: 4k, Photorealistic.
