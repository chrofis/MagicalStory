Rewrite this image scene description to avoid content safety filters while preserving the story moment.

**ORIGINAL SCENE:**
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}

**CONTEXT:**
- This is for a children's book illustration
- The scene was blocked by image generation safety filters
- We need to keep the same story moment but make it safer

**REWRITE RULES:**
1. Remove any potentially problematic elements:
   - Physical contact that could be misinterpreted (hugging from behind, lifting, carrying)
   - Children in vulnerable positions (sleeping, bathing, changing)
   - Dark or scary imagery (monsters, shadows, fear)
   - Any violence, even playful (sword fights, wrestling, chasing aggressively)
   - Water/swimming scenes with children
   - Bedtime/bedroom scenes

2. Keep the emotional essence:
   - If it was a bonding moment, show characters smiling together side-by-side
   - If it was an adventure moment, show characters looking at something exciting
   - If it was a comfort moment, show characters sitting near each other peacefully

3. Safe alternatives:
   - Instead of hugging: standing/sitting side by side, smiling at each other
   - Instead of carrying: walking together hand-in-hand (if adult and child)
   - Instead of bedtime: daytime cozy scene (reading together on couch)
   - Instead of bath: playing in garden with water hose or at a fountain
   - Instead of scary: mysterious but bright and colorful

4. Add safe visual elements:
   - Bright daylight or warm indoor lighting
   - Open outdoor spaces (gardens, parks, meadows)
   - Cheerful colors and expressions
   - Characters at appropriate distances
   - All characters fully clothed in everyday attire

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY the rewritten scene description, nothing else. Keep the same format as the original (Setting, Characters, Action, Mood).
