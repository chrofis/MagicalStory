--- STORY REQUIREMENTS (OBSERVER) ---

The main characters WITNESS the historical event unfold - they are observers, not the famous figures.
They experience history from the sidelines as a child, neighbor, friend, helper, or curious onlooker.

Examples of observer roles:
- Moon landing: "Emma and Max watch the Moon landing on TV with their family, dreaming of becoming astronauts."
- Wright Brothers: "Sophie is a local child who watches two strange men testing flying machines on the beach."
- Light bulb: "Max is Edison's young assistant who fetches materials and witnesses the breakthrough."
- Pyramids: "Emma is a worker's daughter who sneaks onto the construction site and befriends the architect's son."

IMPORTANT:
- Characters observe, help, or are inspired by the historical figures
- They can interact with the event but don't replace the famous people
- Focus on the child's perspective and what they learn/experience
