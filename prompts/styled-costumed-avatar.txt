{ART_STYLE_PROMPT}

GRID LAYOUT (with clear black dividing lines between quadrants):
+-------------------+-------------------+
|  TOP LEFT         |  TOP RIGHT        |
|  Face - Front     |  Face - 3/4       |
|  (looking at      |  Profile (75deg   |
|   camera)         |   looking RIGHT)  |
+-------------------+-------------------+
|  BOTTOM LEFT      |  BOTTOM RIGHT     |
|  Full Body        |  Full Body        |
|  Front View       |  Profile View     |
|  (facing camera)  |  (facing RIGHT)   |
+-------------------+-------------------+

GRID REQUIREMENTS:
- Draw clear BLACK LINES (2-3px) separating the 4 quadrants
- Both profile views (top right and bottom right) MUST face the SAME direction (RIGHT)
- Each quadrant has clean background appropriate to the art style
- All 4 quadrants show the SAME costume
- TOP QUADRANTS: Head and shoulders, face clearly visible
- BOTTOM QUADRANTS: Full body from head to toe, shoes visible

IDENTITY PERSISTENCE (CRITICAL):
- Face: 100% identical to reference photo - Direct replication, not averaged - same face shape, features, expression style
- The person must be clearly recognizable as the same individual
- Hair color, eye color, skin tone must match exactly
- The output MUST preserve the exact age, ethnicity, facial geometry, and unique micro-markers of the person in the provided reference photos
- If the subject is a child, they MUST remain a child with child-like proportions and features. Do not mature the face.
- If the subject has specific facial markers (moles, scars, eye shape), these MUST be retained with 100% accuracy.
- Body: Use the APPARENT AGE and BUILD from PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS below. Generate age-appropriate body proportions matching that age category.
- Lighting: Natural, even, studio-style diffused light.
- NO "BEAUTIFICATION".Do not apply "Standard Fashion Model" features. The face must be a literal duplicate of the reference.
- The goal is a photographic "Documentary" level of facial realism.
- Apply the art style while preserving identity
