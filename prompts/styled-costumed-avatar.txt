TASK: Create a 2x2 GRID IMAGE with 4 views of the EXACT individual from the reference images.

REFERENCE IMAGES PROVIDED:
- Image 1: High-resolution face photo - use for EXACT facial identity (face shape, features, skin tone, eye color, hair)
- Image 2 (if provided): Standard avatar - use for body proportions and build reference

ART STYLE (CRITICAL - apply to entire image):
{ART_STYLE_PROMPT}

GRID LAYOUT (with clear black dividing lines between quadrants):
+-------------------+-------------------+
|  TOP LEFT         |  TOP RIGHT        |
|  Face - Front     |  Face - 3/4       |
|  (looking at      |  Profile (75deg   |
|   camera)         |   looking RIGHT)  |
+-------------------+-------------------+
|  BOTTOM LEFT      |  BOTTOM RIGHT     |
|  Full Body        |  Full Body        |
|  Front View       |  Profile View     |
|  (facing camera)  |  (facing RIGHT)   |
+-------------------+-------------------+

GRID REQUIREMENTS:
- Draw clear BLACK LINES (2-3px) separating the 4 quadrants
- Both profile views (top right and bottom right) MUST face the SAME direction (RIGHT)
- Each quadrant has white background 
- All 4 quadrants show the SAME costume
- TOP QUADRANTS: Head and shoulders, face clearly visible
- BOTTOM QUADRANTS: Full body from head to toe, shoes visible

IDENTITY PERSISTENCE (CRITICAL):
- Face: 100% identical to Image 1 (face photo) - Direct replication, not averaged - same face shape, features, expression style
- The person must be clearly recognizable as the same individual
- Hair color, eye color, skin tone must match exactly from Image 1
- The output MUST preserve the exact age, ethnicity, facial geometry, and unique micro-markers of the person in Image 1
- If the subject is a child, they MUST remain a child with child-like proportions and features. Do not mature the face.
- If the subject has specific facial markers (moles, scars, eye shape), these MUST be retained with 100% accuracy.
- Body: If Image 2 (standard avatar) is provided, use its body proportions. Otherwise use PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS below.
- Lighting: Natural, even, studio-style diffused light.
- NO "BEAUTIFICATION". Do not apply "Standard Fashion Model" features. The face must be a literal duplicate of Image 1.
- The goal is a photographic "Documentary" level of facial realism.
- Apply the art style while preserving identity

COSTUME - {COSTUME_TYPE}:
{COSTUME_DESCRIPTION}

This is a COMPLETE outfit change. The character wears this entire costume from head to toe.
Include ALL costume elements: headwear, shirt/top, pants/skirt/dress, footwear, and any accessories.
