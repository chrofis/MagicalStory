{{EXPECTED_CHARACTERS}}

{{EXPECTED_OBJECTS}}

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Values are 0-1000 (Gemini native format)
- Origin is top-left corner
- Format: [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]

FOR EACH FIGURE:
- If you can identify it as an expected character, set "name" to the character name (EXACTLY as listed above)
- If not identifiable as any expected character, set "name" to "UNKNOWN"
- Include "confidence": "high", "medium", or "low" for identification certainty
- face_box: bounding box around the FACE only (forehead to chin, ear to ear)
- body_box: bounding box around the FULL BODY (or as much as visible)
- If face is not visible (back view, non-human creature), set face_box to null

FOR EXPECTED OBJECTS:
- Report "found": true/false for each expected object
- If found, include body_box bounding box and position

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "figures": [
    {
      "name": "CharacterName or UNKNOWN",
      "label": "visual description (e.g., 'boy in blue hoodie')",
      "position": "left|center|right",
      "face_box": [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] or null,
      "body_box": [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max],
      "confidence": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ],

EXAMPLE - Scene with two children and a dog:
Given expected characters: "Lukas (boy, 7 years old, blonde hair)" and "Mia (girl, 3 years old, brown curly hair)"
Given expected objects: "golden crown", "brown teddy bear"

{
  "figures": [
    {
      "name": "Lukas",
      "label": "boy with blonde hair in blue hoodie",
      "position": "left",
      "face_box": [120, 100, 220, 200],
      "body_box": [100, 50, 650, 300],
      "confidence": "high"
    },
    {
      "name": "Mia",
      "label": "girl with curly brown hair in pink dress",
      "position": "right",
      "face_box": [150, 700, 250, 800],
      "body_box": [130, 600, 680, 900],
      "confidence": "high"
    },
    {
      "name": "UNKNOWN",
      "label": "golden retriever dog",
      "position": "center",
      "face_box": null,
      "body_box": [500, 400, 700, 600],
      "confidence": "n/a"
    }
  ],
  "objects": [
    {
      "name": "golden crown",
      "found": true,
      "label": "golden crown on table",
      "position": "center",
      "body_box": [300, 450, 350, 520]
    },
    {
      "name": "brown teddy bear",
      "found": false,
      "label": null,
      "position": null,
      "body_box": null
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Detect ALL visible figures, even if partially visible or UNKNOWN
- Be precise with bounding boxes - they will be used for inpainting
- Match characters based on age, gender, and physical description, not just position
- For creatures/animals/non-humans that are not expected characters, use "UNKNOWN"
