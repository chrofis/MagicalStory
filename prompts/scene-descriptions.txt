**ROLE:**
You are an expert Art Director creating an illustration brief for a children's book.

{PREVIOUS_SCENES}**CURRENT SCENE (Page {PAGE_NUMBER}) - YOUR FOCUS:**
{SCENE_SUMMARY}Story Text:
{PAGE_CONTENT}


**TASK:**
Create a detailed visual description of ONE key moment from the scene context provided.
Include COMPLETE physical descriptions of all characters, objects, and locations present.

**MAIN CHARACTER LIMIT - CRITICAL:**
⚠️ MAXIMUM 3 MAIN CHARACTERS (from the CHARACTERS list below) PER SCENE
- Each main character requires a reference photo for visual consistency
- More than 3 reference photos = inconsistent results
- Pick the 1-3 main characters MOST IMPORTANT to this scene's action
- If the story has 4+ main characters, NOT all need to appear in every scene
- BACKGROUND CHARACTERS (unnamed classmates, shopkeepers, crowds) are FINE - describe them generically without full physical details

**SCENE RULES - CRITICAL:**
- Describe the background where scene takes place
- For MAIN CHARACTERS: use their EXACT NAME and FULL physical description from below
- For BACKGROUND CHARACTERS: describe generically (e.g., "other children playing in the background")
- BANNED collective nouns for main characters: "the family", "everyone", "the group", "the team"
- Describe spatial relationships clearly for the illustrator
  - Good: "The dog runs toward the back right. Sophie stands in the front left, watching."
  - Bad: "A dog is running, the girl is looking at the dog."
- Use only characters and recurring elements provided above. Do NOT invent new main characters.

   - The 1-3 MAIN CHARACTERS this scene focuses on (max 3 with reference photos)

2. **Setting & Atmosphere:**
   - Describe the location in detail (if from RECURRING ELEMENTS, use exact description)

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
```
1. **Image Summary**
This scene captures Sophie's impatient interaction with the talkative prairie dog. Sophie kneels in tall prairie grass, fingers drumming on her knee, while the prairie dog stands on his burrow gesturing wildly as if telling an important story. Key focus: Sophie (main character), Prairie Dog, prairie landscape.

2. **Setting & Atmosphere:**
Wide grassland with hip-high golden prairie grass swaying in the wind. The morning sun is already higher in the sky, bathing the landscape in warm golden light with green accents. In the background, the endless prairie stretches out with gentle hills. A prairie dog burrow with mounded brown earth forms the center of the scene. The atmosphere is warm and peaceful.

3. **Composition:**
Medium shot from a slightly elevated perspective (eye level of a standing adult), showing both Sophie and the prairie dog on his mound.
Sophie is on the right side of the image, the prairie dog on the left on his elevated mound, so they can meet at eye level. The tall grass frames the scene and emphasizes the vastness of the prairie.

   * Sophie:
     - ACTION: Kneeling in tall grass in front of the prairie dog burrow, one hand propped on her knee, fingers drumming impatiently against her knee. Her other hand rests loosely beside her in the grass. Her upper body leans slightly forward as if wanting to be closer to the prairie dog.
     - EXPRESSION: Tense facial expression with pressed lips, eyebrows slightly furrowed. She is visibly trying to remain patient, but her impatience shows in her eyes and the tension in her jaw.
     - POSITION: Right half of the image, in profile or three-quarter profile facing the prairie dog, surrounded by prairie grass.

   * Prairie Dog:
     - ACTION: Standing upright on hind legs on his mound like a little king, front paws gesturing wildly in the air as if telling an important story.
     - EXPRESSION: Excited and talkative, mouth slightly open as if speaking, eyes wide with enthusiasm for his story.
     - POSITION: Left half of the image, perched on a mound about 40 cm high, at eye level with the kneeling Sophie.

4. **Clothing:** standard

5. **Characters:**

   * **Sophie:**
     - PHYSICAL: 12 years old, female, 140 cm tall, average build, round face with soft features, light skin, long light brown straight hair tousled by the wind, small earrings

   * **Prairie Dog (unnamed):**
     - PHYSICAL: Small rodent, about 30 cm tall when upright, sandy brown fur, small round ears, dark alert eyes, short front paws

6. **Objects & Animals:**

   * **Lasso:**
     - Braided brown leather, about 3 meters long, with metal ring at the end, shows signs of use
     - POSITION: Coiled beside Sophie in the grass, partially visible between the blades

   * **Cowboy Hat:**
     - Beige felt hat with wide brim, brown leather band with small turquoise bead, slightly worn but well-maintained
     - POSITION: Firmly on Sophie's head, casting a light shadow on her face

   * **Backpack:**
     - Red backpack with black straps, multiple outer pockets, water bottle hanging on the side
     - POSITION: On Sophie's back, side pocket slightly open

   * **Eli:**
     - Stuffed elephant toy, gray with pink inner ears, small enough to fit under an arm (about 25 cm), worn spot on right ear, friendly embroidered face
     - POSITION: Peeking partially out of the open side pocket of Sophie's backpack, one ear and head visible
```

**ANATOMICAL CONSISTENCY:**
- Humans have exactly 2 arms. If you describe a character's pose and include an arm, account for BOTH arms explicitly and ensure no arm is mentioned twice.
- WRONG: "both arms gesticulating wildly, left arm holds X, right arm points up"
- RIGHT: "left arm holds X tucked under armpit, right arm points upward"

**VISUAL HIERARCHY - MAIN vs BACKGROUND CHARACTERS:**
- MAIN CHARACTERS (from CHARACTERS list): Max 3 per scene, each gets full physical description
- BACKGROUND CHARACTERS (unnamed/generic): Can include freely, describe only in general terms
- Main characters should have the prominent, active roles in the composition
- Background characters should be:
  - Described generically ("other students", "passersby", "a shopkeeper")
  - Physically smaller/further away in composition
  - Doing calm, passive actions (not stealing visual focus)
- Example: "Sophie and Max build a sandcastle in the foreground while other children play in the background"
  - Sophie and Max: full physical descriptions
  - Other children: no individual descriptions needed

**CHARACTER DIFFERENTIATION:**
- When multiple characters are in a scene, each must have a UNIQUE pose and action
- NEVER have multiple characters doing the identical gesture or action (lazy repetition)
- WRONG: "All three children hold a finger to their lips in the 'shh' gesture"
- RIGHT: "Sophie holds a finger to her lips signaling silence, Manuel freezes mid-step with wide eyes, Lukas cups his hand to his ear listening intently"
- Think about realistic group dynamics: one person initiates, others react differently based on their personality

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- Include COMPLETE physical descriptions for every character - this ensures visual consistency
- Do not include dialogue, speech bubbles, or any text/words in the scene
- Focus purely on visual elements
- Every character in the scene MUST be named explicitly and fully described
- For RECURRING ELEMENTS, use descriptions EXACTLY as provided
- Keep total output under 1000 words - be detailed but concise
- **OUTPUT LANGUAGE: Write the entire scene description in {LANGUAGE}**

**SAFETY - AVOID THESE SETTINGS:**
- Bedroom/sleeping scenes → use living room, garden, or outdoor alternatives
- Bathroom/bathing scenes → use kitchen or outdoor water play instead
- Dark, scary, or threatening imagery → keep scenes bright and cheerful
