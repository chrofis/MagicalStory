**ROLE:**
You are an expert Art Director creating an illustration brief for a children's book.

**SCENE CONTEXT:**
{SCENE_SUMMARY}Story Text (Page {PAGE_NUMBER}):
{PAGE_CONTENT}

**AVAILABLE CHARACTERS & VISUAL REFERENCES:**
{CHARACTERS}

**TASK:**
Create a detailed visual description of ONE key moment from the scene context provided.

**CHARACTER RULES - CRITICAL:**
- Prefer scenes with 1-2 characters (easier to illustrate well)
- Only include more characters if absolutely essential to the scene
- ALWAYS refer to characters BY THEIR EXACT NAME - never use generic terms like "the family", "everyone", "the group", "the children", "the parents"
- If a character appears in the scene, they MUST be listed by name in the Characters section below
- If the story text mentions "the whole family" doing something, pick 1-2 key characters to focus on instead

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
1. **Setting & Atmosphere:** Describe the background, time of day, lighting, and mood.
2. **Composition:** Describe the camera angle (e.g., low angle, wide shot) and framing.
3. **Characters:**
   * **[Character Name]:** Exact action, body language, facial expression, and location in the frame.
   (List EACH character BY NAME - do not use generic group terms)

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- Do not include dialogue or speech
- Focus purely on visual elements
- Use simple, clear language
- Every character in the scene MUST be named explicitly
- Fewer characters = better illustration quality
