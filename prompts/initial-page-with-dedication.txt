**SCENE:**
{INITIAL_PAGE_SCENE}

**ART STYLE:** {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE but styled artistically
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style
{CHARACTER_REFERENCE_LIST}
**COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:**
- This is a GROUP scene introducing all the story's characters
- The MAIN CHARACTER should be positioned in the CENTER
- Other characters should be arranged AROUND the main character
- Everyone should be clearly visible and recognizable
- Create a warm, inviting atmosphere that welcomes readers

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact dedication text: "{DEDICATION}"
- Make the dedication text elegant and readable
- Position it prominently in the image (typically top or bottom)
- Do NOT add any other text - ONLY the dedication text above

**VISUAL REFERENCE ELEMENTS (optional):**
You may use elements from the visual bible below if appropriate for this scene.
These elements are NOT required - only include them if they naturally fit the cover composition.
If you DO include any element, describe it EXACTLY as specified below (verbatim).
