CHILDREN'S BOOK ILLUSTRATION - Safe, family-friendly content.
Create an introduction page illustration for a children's book.

**SCENE:**
{INITIAL_PAGE_SCENE}

**ART STYLE:** {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS - transform into the art style
- Characters must remain RECOGNIZABLE (hair color, face shape, age, gender)
- Render in artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters in the SAME consistent style
- Character CLOTHING: Use EXACTLY what is shown in the reference images (the correct outfit has been pre-selected)

{CHARACTER_REFERENCE_LIST}

**REFERENCE IMAGE USAGE (CRITICAL):**
- Reference photos are PROVIDED FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING ONLY
- DO NOT include reference photos, thumbnails, or numbered image grids in the generated image
- The output must be a SINGLE illustration showing ONLY the described scene
- Reference photos show what characters LOOK LIKE - use them to draw the characters accurately, but NEVER show the photos themselves

**COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:**
- This is a GROUP scene introducing all the story's characters
- The MAIN CHARACTER should be positioned in the CENTER
- Other characters should be arranged AROUND the main character
- Everyone should be clearly visible and recognizable
- Create a warm, inviting atmosphere that welcomes readers

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact dedication text: "{DEDICATION}"
- Make the dedication text elegant and readable
- Position it prominently in the image (typically top or bottom)
- Do NOT add any other text - ONLY the dedication text above
