Create a dedication page illustration for a children's book.

**SCENE:**
{INITIAL_PAGE_SCENE}

**ART STYLE:** {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}

{CHARACTER_INFO}

**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS of people
- Transform these people into the requested art style
- Characters must be RECOGNIZABLE but styled artistically
- ALL characters must have the SAME consistent art style

**COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:**
- This is a GROUP scene introducing all the story's characters
- The MAIN CHARACTER should be positioned in the CENTER
- Other characters should be arranged AROUND the main character
- Everyone should be clearly visible and recognizable
- Create a warm, inviting atmosphere that welcomes readers

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact dedication text: "{DEDICATION}"
- Make the dedication text elegant and readable
- Position it prominently in the image (typically top or bottom)
- Do NOT add any other text - ONLY the dedication text above
