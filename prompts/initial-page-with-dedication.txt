**STYLE TRANSFORMATION:**
- Reference images show REAL PHOTOGRAPHS - transform into the art style
- Characters must remain RECOGNIZABLE (hair color, face shape, age, gender)
- Render in artistic style - NOT photo-realistic copies
- ALL characters in the SAME consistent style
- Character CLOTHING: Use clothing described in the scene below. If not specified, use EXACTLY as shown in the reference images

**COMPOSITION GUIDELINES:**
- This is a GROUP scene introducing all the story's characters
- The MAIN CHARACTER should be positioned in the CENTER
- Other characters should be arranged AROUND the main character
- Everyone should be clearly visible and recognizable
- Create a warm, inviting atmosphere that welcomes readers

**TEXT REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:**
The image MUST include this exact dedication text: "{DEDICATION}"
- Make the dedication text elegant and readable
- Position it prominently in the image (typically top or bottom)
- Do NOT add any other text - ONLY the dedication text above
