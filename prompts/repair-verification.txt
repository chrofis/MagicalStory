Compare these two image regions: BEFORE (left) and AFTER (right).

This is a CROP from a larger illustration. The repair should ONLY fix the specific issue while keeping everything else identical.

ISSUE TO FIX:
- Problem: "{ISSUE_DESCRIPTION}"
- Fix instruction: "{FIX_INSTRUCTION}"
- Issue type: {ISSUE_TYPE}

EVALUATE CAREFULLY:

1. ISSUE FIXED? Is the specific problem mentioned above fixed in the AFTER image?

2. POSITION PRESERVED? Are ALL elements in the EXACT same position?
   - Nothing should have moved, shifted, or been resized
   - This crop goes back into a larger image - alignment is critical

3. STYLE PRESERVED? Does the AFTER match the BEFORE exactly in:
   - Art style and line quality
   - Colors and lighting
   - Background and textures

4. MINIMAL CHANGE? Was ONLY the fix instruction applied?
   - No other "improvements" or changes should be visible
   - Everything except the fix should be pixel-perfect identical

5. NEW PROBLEMS? Check for:
   - {TYPE_SPECIFIC_CHECKS}
   - Blurry or smeared areas
   - Unnatural color transitions
   - Elements that don't connect properly
   - Shifted or misaligned elements
