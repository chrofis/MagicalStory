Compare these two image regions: BEFORE (left) and AFTER (right).

The original issue was: "{ISSUE_DESCRIPTION}"
Fix instruction was: "{FIX_INSTRUCTION}"
Issue type: {ISSUE_TYPE}

EVALUATE carefully:
1. Is the issue FIXED in the AFTER image? Look for the specific problem mentioned.
2. Is there any VISIBLE CHANGE between BEFORE and AFTER? (Even subtle changes count)
3. Are there any NEW PROBLEMS in the AFTER image? Check for:
   - {TYPE_SPECIFIC_CHECKS}
   - Blurry or smeared areas
   - Unnatural color transitions
   - Objects that don't connect properly

Return JSON only:
{
  "fixed": true/false,
  "changed": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "explanation": "brief explanation of what you see",
  "newProblems": ["list any new issues found"] or []
