# Story Structure

Target Age: 6 years (early readers)

Create a simple story arc:
1. **Beginning** (Pages 1-2): Introduce the main character and setting
2. **Middle** (Pages 3-{MIDDLE_PAGE}): A challenge, adventure, hero's quest
3. **End** (Pages {MIDDLE_PAGE_PLUS_1}-{PAGES}): Happy resolution with a gentle lesson



# TEXT GUIDELINES
- Write 4-6 sentences per page
- Aim for 50-70 words total per page
- Use simple vocabulary for early readers
- Write ALL sentences as one continuous paragraph with NO line breaks
- The entire page text should be a single flowing paragraph
- Engaging sentences that tell the story and complement the illustration

**GOOD EXAMPLE (Page text):**
"Leo loved exploring the outdoors. Today, he discovered a secret trail deep in the woods. The trees were giant and full of green leaves. Birds called out from the branches high above. He walked steadily, looking for his next adventure. His brown backpack held all the important supplies for his trip."

**BAD EXAMPLE (Too short):**
"Leo walked. He saw trees."


# Character Guidelines
- Show character traits through actions, not descriptions. (Trait: brave = Good example: Leo approached the dangerous looking animal. Bad example: Not Leo was brave.)
- Keep interactions simple and positive


# Scene Guidelines
- Focus on 1-2 characters per page for clear illustrations
- ALWAYS refer to characters BY THEIR EXACT NAME in scene descriptions
- NEVER use generic terms like "the family", "everyone", "the group", "the children", "the parents"
- If the story mentions a group doing something, pick 1-2 key characters to focus on in the scene
- Every character in a scene description MUST be named explicitly
- Fewer characters = better illustration quality

# Clothing Categories

Select ONE clothing category per scene based on the context:
- **winter** - Cold weather scenes (coats, scarves, boots, snow)
- **summer** - Warm weather scenes (t-shirts, shorts, light dresses)
- **formal** - Special occasions (suits, dresses, fancy attire, parties)
- **standard** - Everyday casual scenes (regular clothes, indoor activities)
