Your task is to create a complete, compelling, well-structured story.

{BASE_PROMPT}

Here is the story outline:
{OUTLINE}

IMPORTANT: Now write the complete story following the outline above.
Your goal is to write a complete, engaging story.

You **MUST** write exactly **{PAGES} pages** (Pages 1 through {PAGES}).
**Do NOT stop** until all {PAGES} pages are complete.
Ensure there is **exactly one "--- Page X ---" marker per page**.
Distribute the story content evenly across all {PAGES} pages, maintaining a consistent pace.
Write engaging, age-appropriate content for each page, maintaining a consistent narrative voice and tone.
Ensure all characters consistently reflect their established traits, ages, and relationships from the BASE_PROMPT.

FORMATTING:
- Write in natural, flowing paragraphs (2-4 sentences each is ideal)
- Start a new paragraph for: dialogue exchanges, scene changes, new actions, or shifts in focus
- Dialogue can be on its own line for clarity, but group related exchanges together
- Avoid putting EVERY sentence on its own line - that's too fragmented
- Aim for a balanced, readable style like a picture book or early chapter book

Output Format:
--- Page 1 ---
[Story text for page 1...]

--- Page 2 ---
[Story text for page 2...]

...continue until page {PAGES}...
