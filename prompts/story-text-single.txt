{OUTLINE}

# Current Visual Bible
{VISUAL_BIBLE}

# Your Task

**STEP 1: Add Visual Bible entries (MINIMUM 5 ENTRIES REQUIRED - output FIRST)**

You MUST add at least 5 entries to the Visual Bible. Scan the outline and ADD:
- **ALL LOCATIONS** - Every distinct place in the story (rooms, outdoor areas, buildings, etc.)
- **ALL OBJECTS** - Every important item (toys, tools, magical items, furniture, vehicles, food, etc.)
- **ALL ANIMALS/PETS** - Any animals that appear
- **ALL SECONDARY CHARACTERS** - Anyone who is not a main character

**IMPORTANT:** Even if an element appears only once, add it to ensure visual consistency.
Do NOT write "None" - find at least 5 elements to add.

Output your entries at the START of your response using the format below.

**STEP 2: Write the complete story**
IMPORTANT: Now write the complete story following the outline above.
Your goal is to write a complete, engaging story.

You **MUST** write exactly **{PAGES} pages** (Pages 1 through {PAGES}).
**Do NOT stop** until all {PAGES} pages are complete.
Ensure there is **exactly one "--- Page X ---" marker per page**.
Distribute the story content evenly across all {PAGES} pages, maintaining a consistent pace.
Write engaging, age-appropriate content for each page, maintaining a consistent narrative voice and tone.
Ensure all characters consistently reflect their established traits, ages, and relationships from the BASE_PROMPT.

FORMATTING:
- Write in flowing paragraphs with 2-4 sentences each
- Maximum 3-4 paragraphs per page
- Dialogues flow inline with the narrative text
- Scene changes or location changes = start a NEW PAGE, not a new paragraph
- Create a readable, engaging style appropriate for the target age

Output Format:
