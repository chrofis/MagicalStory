Analyze this children's book illustration and describe the following elements in EXACT visual detail.
These descriptions will be used to maintain consistency in future illustrations.

Elements to describe:
{ELEMENTS_LIST}

For EACH element, provide a detailed description including:
- Exact colors (be specific: "bright red" not just "red", "golden yellow" not just "yellow")
- Size relative to other elements in the scene
- Distinctive features, markings, patterns
- For characters: clothing details, hair style, accessories
- For animals: fur/feather patterns, collar or accessories
- For objects: material, condition (new/worn), unique markings
- Art style characteristics (how is it rendered?)

Respond in JSON format:
{
  "elements": [
    {
      "name": "element name exactly as listed above",
      "description": "detailed visual description, 2-3 sentences with specific details"
    }
  ]
}

Be extremely specific about colors and visual details - these descriptions must be precise enough to recreate the exact same appearance.
