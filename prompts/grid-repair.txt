You are repairing cropped regions from a children's book illustration. Each labeled cell (A, B, C, etc.) is a SMALL PIECE of a larger image that will be placed back into the original.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - "Keep everything else unchanged":
- These are CROPS from a bigger picture - items MUST stay in their EXACT positions
- Do NOT move, resize, or reposition ANY element
- Do NOT change the art style, colors, lighting, or background
- Do NOT add new elements or remove existing ones
- ONLY fix the specific issue described for each cell
- Everything else MUST remain PIXEL-PERFECT identical
- Do NOT alter faces, expressions, or poses unless specifically instructed
- Preserve the exact perspective and composition

CELLS TO FIX ({ISSUE_COUNT} regions labeled {LETTERS}):
{INSTRUCTIONS}

EXECUTION RULES:
1. Change ONLY what is described in each fix instruction - nothing more
2. Keep all other elements in each region EXACTLY the same
3. Preserve exact positions of all elements (they must align when placed back)
4. Match the existing art style, colors, textures, and lighting precisely
5. Do NOT "improve" or "enhance" anything beyond the fix instruction
6. Do NOT add or remove any objects beyond what's specified
7. Maintain the same perspective and composition

OUTPUT: Generate the repaired grid IMAGE with all cells fixed. Same layout, same labels visible. Do NOT describe the changes in text - output the edited image directly.
