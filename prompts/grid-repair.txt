You are repairing cropped regions from a children's book illustration. Each labeled cell (A, B, C, etc.) is a SMALL PIECE of a larger image that will be placed back into the original.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- These are CROPS from a bigger picture - items MUST stay in their EXACT positions
- Do NOT move, resize, or reposition ANY element
- Do NOT change the art style, colors, lighting, or background
- Do NOT add new elements or remove existing ones
- ONLY fix the specific issue described for each cell
- Everything else MUST remain PIXEL-PERFECT identical

CELLS TO FIX ({ISSUE_COUNT} regions labeled {LETTERS}):
{INSTRUCTIONS}

EXECUTION RULES:
1. For each cell, make ONLY the change described - nothing more
2. Preserve exact positions of all elements (they must align when placed back)
3. Match the existing art style precisely
4. Keep all colors, textures, and shading identical
5. Do not "improve" or "enhance" anything beyond the fix instruction

OUTPUT: Generate the repaired grid IMAGE with all cells fixed. Same layout, same labels visible. Do NOT describe the changes in text - output the edited image directly.
