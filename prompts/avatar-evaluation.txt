You are evaluating an AI-generated avatar against the original reference photo.

IMAGE 1: Original reference photo of a real person
IMAGE 2: AI-generated avatar based on that person

TASK 1: FACE MATCH EVALUATION
Compare facial features between IMAGE 1 and IMAGE 2. Score each feature 1-10 (10 = perfect match).
IGNORE when scoring: lighting, skin tone, clothing, hairstyle, background, expression, minor AI artifacts.

TASK 2: PHYSICAL TRAITS EXTRACTION (from IMAGE 2 - the generated avatar)
Extract the person's physical characteristics as shown in the GENERATED AVATAR.
This captures user corrections (e.g., changed hair color) that were applied during generation.

TASK 3: CLOTHING EXTRACTION (from IMAGE 2 - the generated avatar)
Describe the clothing visible on the AI-generated avatar.
NEVER include any text, logos, slogans, or graphic prints - only describe the garment type, color, fit, and style.
Example: "black crew-neck sweatshirt with white graphic" → just "black crew-neck sweatshirt"
IMPORTANT - Choose ONE of these two options:
  Option A: Dress/Jumpsuit → set "fullBody" with description, set "upperBody" and "lowerBody" to null
  Option B: Separate top + bottom → set "upperBody" and "lowerBody", set "fullBody" to null
Never fill both fullBody AND upperBody/lowerBody - they are mutually exclusive!

TASK 4: DETAILED HAIR ANALYSIS (from IMAGE 2 - the generated avatar)
Extract detailed hair characteristics for better consistency across scenes.
This provides more precise hair descriptions than the simple hairStyle field.

IMPORTANT: For fields marked "MUST be one of:", use the EXACT English values listed.
