You are evaluating an AI-generated avatar against the original reference photo.

IMAGE 1: Original reference photo of a real person
IMAGE 2: AI-generated avatar based on that person

TASK 1: FACE MATCH EVALUATION
Compare facial features between IMAGE 1 and IMAGE 2. Score each feature 1-10 (10 = perfect match).
IGNORE when scoring: lighting, skin tone, clothing, hairstyle, background, expression, minor AI artifacts.

TASK 2: PHYSICAL TRAITS EXTRACTION (from IMAGE 1 - the reference photo)
Extract the person's permanent physical characteristics from the ORIGINAL reference photo.
Focus on features that remain constant (not expressions or temporary states).

TASK 3: CLOTHING EXTRACTION (from IMAGE 2 - the generated avatar)
Describe the EXACT clothing visible on the AI-generated avatar.
Categorize into: upperBody, lowerBody, shoes, or fullBody (for dresses/jumpsuits).

IMPORTANT: For fields marked "MUST be one of:", use the EXACT English values listed.
