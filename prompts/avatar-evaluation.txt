Compare the two faces and determine if they could be the SAME PERSON.

IMAGE 1: Original reference photo
IMAGE 2: Generated avatar (may have minor variations)

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Focus on overall facial identity: general face shape, eye placement, nose shape, mouth
- Allow for MINOR variations in features - the avatar is AI-generated and won't be pixel-perfect
- IGNORE: lighting, skin tone, clothing, hairstyle, background, expression differences, minor age differences
- If the faces are APPROXIMATELY the same person (70%+ similarity), answer YES

BE LENIENT - only answer NO if the faces are clearly different people (different gender, completely different face structure, etc.)

RESPOND WITH ONLY ONE WORD:
- YES if faces match or approximately match
- NO if faces are clearly different people
