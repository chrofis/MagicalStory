You are evaluating an AI-generated avatar against the original reference photo.

IMAGE 1: Original reference photo
IMAGE 2: AI-generated avatar

TASK 1: Evaluate facial similarity. Score each feature 1-10 (10 = perfect match).
IGNORE when scoring: lighting, skin tone, clothing, hairstyle, background, expression, minor AI artifacts.

TASK 2: Describe the EXACT clothing in the generated avatar (IMAGE 2).
List each garment with color and type. Be specific (e.g., "red winter parka", "dark blue jeans", "brown leather boots").

Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure:

{
  "faceShape": {"score": 8, "reason": "Similar oval shape"},
  "eyes": {"score": 9, "reason": "Same shape and spacing"},
  "nose": {"score": 7, "reason": "Slightly different bridge"},
  "mouth": {"score": 8, "reason": "Lip shape matches"},
  "overallStructure": {"score": 8, "reason": "Proportions match"},
  "finalScore": 8,
  "clothing": "red winter parka, dark blue jeans, brown leather boots"
}
